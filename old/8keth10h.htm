<h1>Keith of the Border</h1>
<h2>A Tale of the Plains</h2>



<h1><a name="chap_I"></a>Chapter I</h1>

<h2>The Plainsman</h2>

<p>The man was riding just below the summit of the ridge,
occasionally uplifting his head so as to gaze across
the crest, shading his eyes with one hand to thus
better concentrate his vision. Both horse and rider
plainly exhibited signs of weariness, but every movement
of the latter showed ceaseless vigilance, his glance
roaming the barren ridges, a brown Winchester lying
cocked across the saddle pommel, his left hand taut
on the rein. Yet the horse he bestrode scarcely required
restraint, advancing slowly, with head hanging low,
and only occasionally breaking into a brief trot under
the impetus of the spur.</p>

<p>The rider was a man approaching thirty, somewhat slender
and long of limb, but possessing broad, squared shoulders
above a deep chest, sitting the saddle easily in plainsman
fashion, yet with an erectness of carriage which suggested
military training. The face under the wide brim of
the weather-worn slouch hat was clean-shaven, browned
by sun and wind, and strongly marked, the chin slightly
prominent, the mouth firm, the gray eyes full of character
and daring. His dress was that of rough service, plain
leather &ldquo;chaps,&rdquo; showing marks of hard
usage, a gray woolen shirt turned low at the neck,
with a kerchief knotted loosely about the sinewy bronzed
throat. At one hip dangled the holster of a &ldquo;forty-five,&rdquo;
on the other hung a canvas-covered canteen. His was
figure and face to be noted anywhere, a man from whom
you would expect both thought and action, and one
who seemed to exactly fit into his wild environment.</p>

<p>Where he rode was the very western extreme of the
prairie country, billowed like the sea, and from off
the crest of its higher ridges, the wide level sweep
of the plains was visible, extending like a vast brown
ocean to the foothills of the far-away mountains. Yet
the actual commencement of that drear, barren expanse
was fully ten miles distant, while all about where
he rode the conformation was irregular, comprising
narrow valleys and swelling mounds, with here and there
a sharp ravine, riven from the rock, and invisible
until one drew up startled at its very brink. The
general trend of depression was undoubtedly southward,
leading toward the valley of the Arkansas, yet irregular
ridges occasionally cut across, adding to the confusion.
The entire surrounding landscape presented the same
aspect, with no special object upon which the eye could
rest for guidance--no tree, no upheaval of rock, no
peculiarity of summit, no snake-like trail,--all about
extended the same dull, dead monotony of brown, sun-baked
hills, with slightly greener depressions lying between,
interspersed by patches of sand or the white gleam
of alkali. It was a dreary, deserted land, parched
under the hot summer sun, brightened by no vegetation,
excepting sparse bunches of buffalo grass or an occasional
stunted sage bush, and disclosing nowhere slightest
sign of human habitation.</p>

<p>The rising sun reddened the crest of the hills, and
the rider, halting his willing horse, sat motionless,
gazing steadily into the southwest. Apparently he
perceived nothing there unusual, for he slowly turned
his body about in the saddle, sweeping his eyes, inch
by inch, along the line of the horizon, until the
entire circuit had been completed. Then his compressed
lips smiled slightly, his hand unconsciously patting
the horse&rsquo;s neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;re still alone, old girl,&rdquo;
he said quietly, a bit of Southern drawl in the voice.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try for the trail, and take it easy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He swung stiffly out of the saddle, and with reins
dangling over his shoulder, began the slower advance
on foot, the exhausted horse trailing behind. His
was not a situation in which one could feel certain
of safety, for any ridge might conceal the wary foemen
he sought to avoid, yet he proceeded now with renewed
confidence. It was the Summer of 1868, and the place
the very heart of the Indian country, with every separate
tribe ranging between the Yellowstone and the Brazos,
either restless or openly on the war-path. Rumors
of atrocities were being retold the length and breadth
of the border, and every report drifting in to either
fort or settlement only added to the alarm. For once
at least the Plains Indians had discovered a common
cause, tribal differences had been adjusted in war
against the white invader, and Kiowas, Comanches, Arapahoes,
Cheyennes, and Sioux, had become welded together in
savage brotherhood. To oppose them were the scattered
and unorganized settlers lining the more eastern streams,
guarded by small detachments of regular troops posted
here and there amid that broad wilderness, scarcely
within touch of each other.</p>

<p>Everywhere beyond these lines of patrol wandered roaming
war parties, attacking travellers on the trails, raiding
exposed settlements, and occasionally venturing to
try open battle with the small squads of armed men.
In this stress of sudden emergency--every available
soldier on active duty--civilians had been pressed
into service, and hastily despatched to warn exposed
settlers, guide wagon trains, or carry despatches between
outposts. And thus our rider, Jack Keith, who knew
every foot of the plains lying between the Republican
and the Canadian Rivers, was one of these thus suddenly
requisitioned, merely because he chanced to be discovered
unemployed by the harassed commander of a cantonment
just without the environs of Carson City. Twenty minutes
later he was riding swiftly into the northwest, bearing
important news to General Sheridan, commander of the
Department, who happened at that moment to be at Fort
Cairnes. To Keith this had been merely another page
in a career of adventure; for him to take his life
in his hands had long ago become an old story. He
had quietly performed the special duty allotted him,
watched a squadron of troopers trot forth down the
valley of the Republican, received the hasty thanks
of the peppery little general, and then, having nothing
better to do, traded his horse in at the government
corral for a fresh mount and started back again for
Carson City. For the greater portion of two nights
and a day he had been in the saddle, but he was accustomed
to this, for he had driven more than one bunch of longhorns
up the Texas trail; and as he had slept three hours
at Cairnes, and as his nerves were like steel, the
thought of danger gave him slight concern. He was
thoroughly tired, and it rested him to get out of the
saddle, while the freshness of the morning air was
a tonic, the very breath of which made him forgetful
of fatigue.</p>

<p>After all, this was indeed the very sort of experience
which appealed to him, and always had--this life of
peril in the open, under the stars and the sky. He
had constantly experienced it for so long now, eight
years, as to make it seem merely natural. While he
ploughed steadily forward through the shifting sand
of the coulee, his thought drifted idly back over those
years, and sometimes he smiled, and occasionally frowned,
as various incidents returned to memory. It had been
a rough life, yet one not unusual to those of his
generation. Born of excellent family in tidewater
Virginia, his father a successful planter, his mother
had died while he was still in early boyhood, and
he had grown up cut off from all womanly influence.
He had barely attained his majority, a senior at William
and Mary&rsquo;s College, when the Civil War came;
and one month after Virginia cast in her lot with
the South, he became a sergeant in a cavalry regiment
commanded by his father. He had enjoyed that life and
won his spurs, yet it had cost. There was much not
over pleasant to remember, and those strenuous years
of almost ceaseless fighting, of long night marches,
of swift, merciless raiding, of lonely scouting within
the enemy&rsquo;s lines, of severe wounds, hardship,
and suffering, had left their marks on both body and
soul. His father had fallen on the field at Antietam,
and left him utterly alone in the world, but he had
fought on grimly to the end, until the last flag of
the Confederacy had been furled. By that time, upon
the collar of his tattered gray jacket appeared the
tarnished insignia of a captain. The quick tears dimmed
his eyes even now as he recalled anew that final parting
following Appomattox, the battle-worn faces of his
men, and his own painful journey homeward, defeated,
wounded, and penniless. It was no home when he got
there, only a heap of ashes and a few weed-grown acres.
No familiar face greeted him; not even a slave was
left.</p>

<p>He had honestly endeavored to remain there, to face
the future and work it out alone; he persuaded himself
to feel that this was his paramount duty to the State,
to the memory of the dead. But those very years of
army life made such a task impossible; the dull, dead
monotony of routine, the loneliness, the slowness
of results, became intolerable. As it came to thousands
of his comrades, the call of the West came to him,
and at last he yielded, and drifted toward the frontier.
The life there fascinated him, drawing him deeper
and deeper into its swirling vortex. He became freighter,
mail carrier, hunter, government scout, cowboy foreman.
Once he had drifted into the mountains, and took a
chance in the mines, but the wide plains called him
back once more to their desert loneliness. What an
utter waste it all seemed, now that he looked back
upon it. Eight years of fighting, hardship, and rough
living, and what had they brought him? The reputation
of a hard rider, a daring player at cards, a quick
shot, a scorner of danger, and a bad man to fool with--that
was the whole of a record hardly won. The man&rsquo;s
eyes hardened, his lips set firmly, as this truth
came crushing home. A pretty life story surely, one
to be proud of, and with probably no better ending
than an Indian bullet, or the flash of a revolver
in some barroom fight.</p>

<p>The narrow valley along which he was travelling suddenly
changed its direction, compelling him to climb the
rise of the ridge. Slightly below the summit he halted.
In front extended the wide expanse of the Arkansas
valley, a scene of splendor under the golden rays of
the sun, with vivid contrast of colors, the gray of
rocks, the yellow of sand, the brown of distant hills,
the green of vegetation, and the silver sheen of the
stream half hidden behind the fringe of cottonwoods
lining its banks. This was a sight Keith had often
looked upon, but always with appreciation, and for
the moment his eyes swept across from bluff to bluff
without thought except for its wild beauty. Then he
perceived something which instantly startled him into
attention--yonder, close beside the river, just beyond
that ragged bunch of cottonwoods, slender spirals of
blue smoke were visible. That would hardly be a camp
of freighters at this hour of the day, and besides,
the Santa F&eacute; trail along here ran close in against
the bluff, coming down to the river at the ford two
miles further west. No party of plainsmen would ever
venture to build a fire in so exposed a spot, and
no small company would take the chances of the trail.
But surely that appeared to be the flap of a canvas
wagon top a little to the right of the smoke, yet
all was so far away he could not be certain. He stared
in that direction a long while, shading his eyes with
both hands, unable to decide. There were three or
four moving black dots higher up the river, but so
far away he could not distinguish whether men or animals.
Only as outlined against the yellow sand dunes could
he tell they were advancing westward toward the ford.</p>

<p>Decidedly puzzled by all this, yet determined to solve
the mystery and unwilling to remain hidden there until
night, Keith led his horse along the slant of the
ridge, until he attained a sharp break through the
bluff leading down into the valley. It was a rugged
gash, nearly impassable, but a half hour of toil won
them the lower prairie, the winding path preventing
the slightest view of what might be meanwhile transpiring
below. Once safely out in the valley the river could
no longer be seen, while barely a hundred yards away,
winding along like a great serpent, ran the deeply
rutted trail to Santa F&eacute;. In neither direction appeared
any sign of human life. As near as he could determine
from those distant cottonwoods outlined against the
sky, for the smoke spirals were too thin by then to
be observed, the spot sought must be considerably to
the right of where he had emerged. With this idea
in mind he advanced cautiously, his every sense alert,
searching anxiously for fresh signs of passage or
evidence of a wagon train having deserted the beaten
track, and turned south. The trail itself, dustless
and packed hard, revealed nothing, but some five hundred
yards beyond the ravine he discovered what he sought--here two wagons had turned sharply to the left, their
wheels cutting deeply enough into the prairie sod
to show them heavily laden. With the experience of
the border he was able to determine that these wagons
were drawn by mules, two span to each, their small
hoofs clearly defined on the turf, and that they were
being driven rapidly, on a sharp trot as they turned,
and then, a hundred feet further, at a slashing gallop.
Just outside their trail appeared the marks of a galloping
horse. A few rods farther along Keith came to a confused
blur of pony tracks sweeping in from the east, and
the whole story of the chase was revealed as though
he had witnessed it with his own eyes. They must have
been crazy, or else impelled by some grave necessity,
to venture along this trail in so small a party. And
they were travelling west--west! Keith drew a deep
breath, and swore to himself, &ldquo;Of all the blame
fools!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He perceived the picture in all its grewsome details--the
two mule-drawn wagons moving slowly along the trail
in the early morning; the band of hostile Indians
suddenly swooping out from some obscure hiding place
in the bluffs; the discovery of their presence; the
desperate effort at escape; the swerving from the
open trail in vain hope of reaching the river and
finding protection underneath its banks; the frightened
mules galloping wildly, lashed into frenzy by the
man on horseback; the pounding of the ponies&rsquo;
hoofs, punctuated by the exultant yells of the pursuers.
Again he swore:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the blame fools!&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_II"></a>Chapter II</h1>

<h2>The Scene of Tragedy</h2>

<p>Whatever might be the nature of the tragedy it would
be over with long before this, and those moving black
spots away yonder to the west, that he had discerned
from the bluff, were undoubtedly the departing raiders.
There was nothing left for Keith to do except determine
the fate of the unfortunates, and give their bodies
decent burial. That any had escaped, or yet lived,
was altogether unlikely, unless, perchance, women had
been in the party, in which case they would have been
borne away prisoners.</p>

<p>Confident that no hostiles would be left behind to
observe his movements, Keith pressed steadily forward,
leading his horse. He had thus traversed fully half
a mile before coming upon any evidence of a fight--here
the pursuers had apparently come up with the wagons,
and circled out upon either side. From their ponies&rsquo;
tracks there must have been a dozen in the band. Perhaps
a hundred yards further along lay two dead ponies.
Keith examined them closely--both had been ridden
with saddles, the marks of the cinches plainly visible.
Evidently one of the wagon mules had also dropped
in the traces here, and had been dragged along by his
mates. Just beyond came a sudden depression in the
prairie down which the wagons had plunged  so heavily
as to break one of the axles; the wheel lay a few yards
away, and, somewhat to the right, there lay the wreck
of the wagon itself, two dead mules still in the traces,
the vehicle stripped of contents and charred by fire.
A hundred feet farther along was the other wagon, its
tongue broken, the canvas top ripped open, while between
the two were scattered odds and ends of wearing apparel
and provisions, with a pile of boxes smoking grimly.
The remaining mules were gone, and no semblance of
life remained anywhere. Keith dropped his reins over
his horse&rsquo;s head, and, with Winchester cocked
and ready, advanced cautiously.</p>

<p>Death from violence had long since become almost a
commonplace occurrence to Keith, yet now he shrank
for an instant as his eyes perceived the figure of
a man lying motionless across the broken wagon tongue.
The grizzled hair and beard were streaked with blood,
the face almost unrecognizable, while the hands yet
grasped a bent and shattered rifle. Evidently the
man had died fighting, beaten down by overwhelming
numbers after expending his last shot. Then those
fiends had scalped and left him where he fell. Fifty
feet beyond, shot in the back, lay a younger man,
doubled up in a heap, also scalped and dead. That was
all; Keith scouted over a wide circle, even scanning
the stretch of gravel under the river bank, before
he could fully satisfy himself there were no others
in the party. It seemed impossible that these two
travelling alone would have ventured upon such a trip
in the face of known Indian hostility. Yet they must
have done so, and once again his lips muttered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the blame fools!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly he halted, staring about over the prairie,
obsessed by a new thought, an aroused suspicion. There
had appeared merely the hoof-prints of the one horse
alongside of the fleeing wagons when they first turned
out from the trail, and that horse had been newly shod.
But there were two dead ponies lying back yonder;
neither shod, yet both had borne saddles. More than
this, they had been spurred, the blood marks still
plainly visible, and one of them was branded; he remembered
it now, a star and arrow. What could all this portend?
Was it possible this attack was no Indian affair after
all? Was the disfiguring of bodies, the scalping,
merely done to make it appear the act of savages? Driven
to investigation by this suspicion, he passed again
over the trampled ground, marking this time every
separate indentation, every faintest imprint of hoof
or foot. There was no impression of a moccasin anywhere;
every mark remaining was of booted feet. The inference
was sufficiently plain--this had been the deed of
white men, not of red; foul murder, and not savage
war.</p>

<p>The knowledge seemed to seer Keith&rsquo;s brain with
fire, and he sprang to his feet, hands clinched and
eyes blazing. He could have believed this of Indians,
it was according to their nature, their method of warfare;
but the cowardliness of it, the atrocity of the act,
as perpetrated by men of his own race, instantly aroused
within him a desire for vengeance. He wanted to run
the fellows down, to discover their identity. Without
thinking of personal danger, he ran forward on their
trail, which led directly westward, along the line
of cottonwoods. These served to conceal his own movements,
yet for the moment, burning with passion, he was utterly
without caution, without slightest sense of peril.
He must know who was guilty of such a crime; he felt
capable of killing them even as he would venomous
snakes. It was a perfectly plain trail to follow, for
the fugitives, apparently convinced of safety, and
confident their cowardly deed would be charged to
Indian raiders, had made no particular effort at concealment,
but had ridden away at a gallop, their horses&rsquo;
hoofs digging deeply into the soft turf. On this retreat
they had followed closely along the river bank, aiming
for the ford, and almost before he realized it Keith
was himself at the water&rsquo;s edge where the trail
abruptly ended, staring vaguely across toward the
opposite shore. Even as he stood there, realizing
the futility of further pursuit amid the maze of sand
dunes opposite, the sharp reports of two rifles reached
him, spurts of smoke  rose from the farther bank,
and a bullet chugged into the ground at his feet,
while another sang shrilly overhead.</p>

<p>These shots, although neither came sufficiently near
to be alarming, served to send Keith to cover. Cool-headed
and alert now, his first mad rage dissipated, he scanned
the opposite bank cautiously, but could nowhere discover
any evidence of life. Little by little he comprehended
the situation, and decided upon his own action. The
fugitives were aware of his presence, and would prevent
his crossing the stream, yet they were not at all
liable to return to this side and thus reveal their
identity. To attempt any further advance would be
madness, but he felt perfectly secure from molestation
so long as he remained quietly on the north shore.
Those shots were merely a warning to keep back; the
very fact that the men firing kept concealed was proof
positive that they simply wished to be left alone.
They were not afraid of what he knew now, only desirous
of not being seen. Confident as to this, he retreated
openly, without making the slightest effort to conceal
his movements, until he had regained the scene of
murder. In evidence of the truth of his theory no further
shots were fired, and although he watched that opposite
sand bank carefully, not the slightest movement revealed
the presence of others. That every motion he made
was being observed by keen eyes he had no doubt, but
this knowledge did not disconcert him, now that he
felt convinced fear of revealment would keep his watchers
at a safe distance. Whoever they mignt be they were
evidently more anxious to escape discovery than he
was fearful of attack, and possessed no desire to
take his life, unless it became necessary to prevent
recognition. They still had every reason to believe
their attack on the wagons would be credited to hostile
Indians, and would consider it far safer to remain
concealed, and thus harbor this supposition. They
could not suspect that Keith had already stumbled upon
the truth, and was determined to verify it.</p>

<p>Secure in this conception of the situation, yet still
keeping a wary eye about to guard against any treachery,
the plainsman, discovering a spade in the nearest
wagon, hastily dug a hole in the sand, wrapped the
dead bodies in blankets, and deposited them therein,
piling above the mound the charred remains of boxes
as some slight protection against prowling wolves.
He searched the clothing of the men, but found little
to reward the effort, a few letters which were slipped
into his pockets to be read later, some ordinary trinkets
hardly worth preserving except that they might assist
in identifying the victims, and, about the neck of
the elder man, a rather peculiar locket, containing
a portrait painted on ivory. Keith was a long time
opening this, the spring being very ingeniously concealed,
but upon finally succeeding, he looked upon the features
of a woman of middle age, a strong mature face of
marked refinement, exceedingly attractive still, with
smiling dark eyes, and a perfect wealth of reddish
brown hair. He held the locket open in his hands for
several minutes, wondering who she could be, and what
possible connection she could have held with the dead.
Something about that face smiling up into his own
held peculiar fascination for him, gripping him with
a strange feeling of familiarity, touching some dim
memory which failed to respond. Surely he had never
seen the original, for she was not one to be easily
forgotten, and yet eyes, hair, expression, combined
to remind him of some one whom he had seen but could
not bring definitely to mind. There were no names
on the locket, no marks of identification of any kind,
yet realizing the sacredness of it, Keith slipped
the fragile gold chain about his neck, and securely
hid the trinket beneath his shirt.</p>

<p>It was noon by this time, the sun high overhead, and
his horse, with dangling rein, still nibbling daintily
at the short grass. There was no reason for his lingering
longer. He swept his gaze the length and breadth of
the desolate valley, and across the river over the
sand hills. All alike appeared deserted, not a moving
thing being visible between the bluffs and the stream.
Still he had the unpleasant feeling of being watched,
and it made him restless and eager to be away. The
earlier gust of anger, the spirit of revenge, had
left him, but it had merely changed into a dogged
resolution to discover the perpetrators of this outrage
and bring them to justice for the crime. The face
in the locket seemed to ask it of him, and his nature
urged response. But he could hope to accomplish nothing
more here, and the plainsman swung himself into the
saddle. He turned his horse&rsquo;s head eastward,
and rode away. From the deeply rutted trail he looked
back to where the fire still smoked in the midst of
that desolate silence.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_III"></a>Chapter III</h1>

<h2>An Arrest</h2>

<p>The Santa F&eacute; trail was far too exposed to be safely
travelled alone and in broad daylight, but Keith considered
it better to put sufficient space between himself
and those whom he felt confident were still watching
his movements from across the river. How much they
might already suspicion his discoveries he possessed
no means of knowing, yet, conscious of their own guilt,
they might easily feel safer if he were also put out
of the way. He had no anticipation of open attack,
but must guard against treachery. As he rode, his
eyes never left those far-away sand dunes, although
he perceived no movement, no black dot even which
he could conceive to be a possible enemy. Now that
he possessed ample time for thought, the situation
became more puzzling. This tragedy which he had accidentally
stumbled upon must have had a cause other than blind
chance. It was the culmination of a plot, with some
reason behind more important than ordinary robbery.
Apparently the wagons contained nothing of value, merely
the clothing, provisions, and ordinary utensils of
an emigrant party. Nor had the victims&rsquo; pockets
been carefully searched. Only the mules had been taken
by the raiders, and they would be small booty for such
a crime.</p>

<p>The trail, continually skirting the high bluff and
bearing farther away from the river, turned sharply
into a narrow ravine. There was a considerable break
in the rocky barrier here, leading back for perhaps
a hundred yards, and the plainsman turned his horse
that way, dismounting when out of sight among the
bowlders. He could rest here until night with little
danger of discovery. He lay down on the rocks, pillowing
his head on the saddle, but his brain was too active
to permit sleeping. Finally he drew the letters from
out his pocket, and began examining them. They yielded
very little information, those taken from the older
man having no envelopes to show to whom they had been
addressed. The single document found in the pocket
of the other was a memorandum of account at the Pioneer
Store at Topeka, charged to John Sibley, and marked
paid. This then must have been the younger man&rsquo;s
name, as the letters to the other began occasionally
&ldquo;Dear Will.&rdquo; They were missives such as
a wife might write to a husband long absent, yet upon
a mission of deep interest to both. Keith could not
fully determine what this mission might be, as the
persons evidently understood each other so thoroughly
that mere allusion took the place of detail. Twice
the name Phyllis was mentioned, and once a &ldquo;Fred&rdquo;
was also referred to, but in neither instance clearly
enough to reveal the relationship, although the latter
appeared to be pleaded for. Certain references caused
the belief that these letters had been mailed from
some small Missouri town, but no name was mentioned.
They were invariably signed &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo; The
only other paper Keith discovered was a brief itinerary
of the Santa F&eacute; trail extending as far west as the
Raton Mountains, giving the usual camping spots and
places where water was accessible. He slipped the
papers back into his pocket with a distinct feeling
of disappointment, and lay back staring up at the little
strip of blue sky. The silence was profound, even
his horse standing motionless, and finally he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>The sun had disappeared, and even the gray of twilight
was fading out of the sky, when Keith returned again
to consciousness, aroused by his horse rolling on
the soft turf. He awoke thoroughly refreshed, and eager
to get away on his long night&rsquo;s ride. A cold
lunch, hastily eaten, for a fire would have been dangerous,
and he saddled up and was off, trotting out of the
narrow ravine and into the broad trail, which could
be followed without difficulty under the dull gleam
of the stars. Horse and rider were soon at their best,
the animal swinging unurged into the long, easy lope
of prairie travel, the fresh air fanning the man&rsquo;s
face as he leaned forward. Once they halted to drink
from a narrow stream, and then pushed on, hour after
hour, through the deserted night. Keith had little
fear of Indian raiders in that darkness, and every
stride of his horse brought him closer to the settlements
and further removed from danger. Yet eyes and ears
were alert to every shadow and sound. Once, it must
have been after midnight, he drew his pony sharply
back into a rock shadow at the noise of something
approaching from the east. The stage to Santa F&eacute; rattled
past, the four mules trotting swiftly, a squad of
troopers riding hard behind. It was merely a lumping
shadow sweeping swiftly past; he could perceive the
dim outlines of driver and guard, the soldiers swaying
in their saddles, heard the pounding of hoofs, the
creak of axles, and then the apparition disappeared
into the black void. He had not called out--what was
the use? Those people would never pause to hunt down
prairie outlaws, and their guard was sufficient to
prevent attack. They acknowledged but one duty--to
get the mail through on time.</p>

<p>The dust of their passing still in the air, Keith
rode on, the noise dying away in his rear. As the
hours passed, his horse wearied and had to be spurred
into the swifter stride, but the man seemed tireless.
The sun was an hour high when they climbed the long
hill, and loped into Carson City. The cantonment was
to the right, but Keith, having no report to make,
rode directly ahead down the one long street to a
livery corral, leaving his horse there, and sought
the nearest restaurant.</p>

<p>Exhausted by a night of high play and deep drinking
the border town was sleeping off its debauch, saloons
and gambling dens silent, the streets almost deserted.
To Keith, whose former acquaintance with the place
had been entirely after nightfall, the view of it
now was almost a shock--the miserable shacks, the
gaudy saloon fronts, the littered streets, the dingy,
unpainted hotel, the dirty flap of canvas, the unoccupied
road, the dull prairie sweeping away to the horizon,
all composed a hideous picture beneath the sun glare.
He could scarcely find a man to attend his horse,
and at the restaurant a drowsy Chinaman had to be shaken
awake, and frightened into serving him. He sat down
to the miserable meal oppressed with disgust--never
before had his life seemed so mean, useless, utterly
without excuse.</p>

<p>He possessed the appetite of the open, of the normal
man in perfect physical health, and he ate heartily
his eyes wandering out of the open window down the
long, dismal street. A drunken man lay in front of
the &ldquo;Red Light&rdquo; Saloon sleeping undisturbed;
two cur dogs were snarling at each other just beyond
over a bone; a movers&rsquo; wagon was slowly coming
in across the open through a cloud of yellow dust.
That was all within the radius of vision. For the
first time in years the East called him--the old life
of cleanliness and respectability. He swore to himself
as he tossed the Chinaman pay for his breakfast, and
strode out onto the steps. Two men were coming up
the street together from the opposite direction--one
lean, dark-skinned, with black goatee, the other heavily
set with closely trimmed gray beard. Keith knew the
latter, and waited, leaning against the door, one
hand on his hip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Bob,&rdquo; he said genially; &ldquo;they
must have routed you out pretty early to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They shore did, Jack,&rdquo; was the response.
He came up the steps somewhat heavily, his companion
stopping below. &ldquo;The boys raise hell all night,
an&rsquo; then come ter me ter straighten it out in
the mawnin&rsquo;. When did ye git in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An hour ago; had to wake the &lsquo;chink&rsquo;
up to get any chuck. Town looks dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t over lively at this time o&rsquo;
day,&rdquo; permitting his blue eyes to wander up
the silent street, but instantly bringing them back
to Keith&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;but I reckon it&rsquo;ll
wake up later on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stood squarely on both feet, and one hand rested
on the butt of a revolver. Keith noticed this, wondering
vaguely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon yer know, Jack, as how I ginerally
git what I goes after,&rdquo; said the slow, drawling
voice, &ldquo;an&rsquo; that I draw &lsquo;bout as
quick as any o&rsquo; the boys. They tell me yo&rsquo;re
a gun-fighter, but it won&rsquo;t do ye no good ter
make a play yere, fer one o&rsquo; us is sure to git
yer--do yer sabe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get me?&rdquo; Keith&rsquo;s voice and face
expressed astonishment, but not a muscle of his body
moved. &ldquo;What do you mean, Bob--are you fellows
after me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing; got the warrant here,&rdquo; and
he tapped the breast of his shirt with his left hand.</p>

<p>The color mounted into the cheeks of the other, his
lips grew set and white, and his gray eyes darkened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it all out, Marshal,&rdquo; he said sternly,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got me roped and tied. Now what&rsquo;s
the charge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neither man moved, but the one below swung about so
as to face them, one hand thrust out of sight beneath
the tail of his long coat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make him throw up his hands, Bob,&rdquo; he
said sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I reckon thar ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; ter
be no trouble,&rdquo; returned the marshal genially,
yet with no relaxation of attention. &ldquo;Keith knows
me, an&rsquo; expects a fair deal. Still, maybe I
better ask yer to unhitch yer belt, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment Keith seemed to hesitate, plainly puzzled
by the situation and endeavoring to see some way of
escape; then his lips smiled, and he silently unhooked
the belt, handing it over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know you&rsquo;re square, Hicks,&rdquo;
he said, coolly. &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ve unlimbered,
kindly inform me what this is all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon yer don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more than an unborn babe. I have been here
but an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it: if yer had been longer thar
wouldn&rsquo;t be no trouble. Yo&rsquo;re wanted for
killin&rsquo; a couple o&rsquo; men out at Cimmaron
Crossin&rsquo; early yesterday mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith stared at him too completely astounded for the
instant to even speak. Then he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Hicks, do you believe
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I know,&rdquo; returned
the marshal, doubtfully. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem like
ye&rsquo;d do it, but the evidence is straight &lsquo;nough,
an&rsquo; thar ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; fer me ter
do but take ye in. I ain&rsquo;t no jedge an&rsquo;
jury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but you ought to have ordinary sense, an&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ve known me for three years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I have, Jack, but if yer&rsquo;ve gone
wrong, you won&rsquo;t be the first good man I&rsquo;ve
seen do it. Anyhow, the evidence is dead agin you,
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d arrest my own grand-dad if they
give me a warrant agin him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What evidence is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five men swear they saw ye haulin&rsquo; the
bodies about, and lootin&rsquo; the pockets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Keith understood, his heart beating rapidly,
his teeth clenched to keep back an outburst of passion.
So that was their game, was it?--some act of his had
awakened the cowardly suspicions of those watching
him across the river. They were afraid that he knew
them as white men. And they had found a way to safely
muzzle him. They must have ridden hard over those
sand dunes to have reached Carson City and sworn out
this warrant. It was a good trick, likely enough to
hang him, if the fellows only stuck to their story.
All this flashed through his brain, yet somehow he
could not clearly comprehend the full meaning, his
mind confused and dazed by this sudden realization
of danger. His eyes wandered from the steady gaze
of the marshal, who had half drawn his gun fearing
resistance, to the man at the bottom of the steps.
Suddenly it dawned upon him where he had seen that
dark-skinned face, with the black goatee, before--at
the faro table of the &ldquo;Red Light.&rdquo; He
gripped his hands together, instantly connecting that
sneering, sinister face with the plot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who swore out that warrant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, if you need to know,&rdquo; a sarcastic
smile revealing a gleam of white teeth, &ldquo;on
the affidavit of others, friends of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m mostly called &lsquo;Black Bart.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was it; he had the name now--&ldquo;Black Bart.&rdquo;
He straightened up so quickly, his eyes blazing, that
the marshal jerked his gun clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See here, Jack,&rdquo; shortly, &ldquo;are
yer goin&rsquo; to raise a row, or come along quiet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As though the words had aroused him from a bad dream,
Keith turned to front the stern, bearded face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no row, Bob,&rdquo; he said,
quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_IV"></a>Chapter IV</h1>

<h2>An Old Acquaintance</h2>

<p>The Carson City lock-up was an improvised affair,
although a decidedly popular resort. It was originally
a two-room cabin with gable to the street, the front
apartment at one time a low groggery, the keeper sleeping
in the rear room. Whether sudden death, or financial
reverses, had been the cause, the community had in
some manner become possessed of the property, and
had at once dedicated it to the commonweal. For the
purpose thus selected it was rather well adapted, being
strongly built, easily guarded, and on the outskirts
of the town. With iron grating over the windows, the
back door heavily spiked, and the front secured by
iron bars, any prisoner once locked within could probably
be found when wanted. On the occasion of Keith&rsquo;s
arrival, the portion abutting upon the street was
occupied by a rather miscellaneous assembly--the drunk
and disorderly element conspicuous--who were awaiting
their several calls to appear before a local justice
and make answer for various misdeeds. Some were pacing
the floor, others sat moodily on benches ranged against
the wall, while a few were still peacefully slumbering
upon the floor. It was a frowsy, disreputable crowd,
evincing but mild curiosity at the arrival of a new
prisoner. Keith had barely time to glance about, recognizing
no familiarity of face amid the mass peering at him,
as he was hustled briskly forward and thrust into
the rear room, the heavy door closing behind him with
the snap of a spring lock.</p>

<p>He was alone, with only the faintest murmur of voices
coming to him through the thick partition. It was
a room some twelve feet square, open to the roof,
with bare walls, and containing no furniture except
a rude bench. Still dazed by the suddenness of his
arrest, he sank down upon the seat, leaned his head
on his hands, and endeavored to think. It was difficult
to get the facts marshalled into any order or to comprehend
clearly the situation, yet little by little his brain
grasped the main details, and he awoke to a full realization
of his condition, of the forces he must war against.
The actual murderers of those two men on the trail
had had their suspicions aroused by his actions; they
believed he guessed something of their foul deed,
and had determined to clear themselves by charging
the crime directly against him. It was a shrewd trick,
and if they only stuck to their story, ought to succeed.
He had no evidence, other than his own word, and the
marshal had already taken from his pockets the papers
belonging to the slain man. He had not found the locket
hidden under his shirt, yet a more thorough search
would doubtless reveal that also.</p>

<p>Even should the case come to trial, how would it be
possible for him to establish innocence, and--<i>would
it ever come to trial?</i> Keith knew the character
of the frontier, and of Carson City. The inclination
of its citizens in such cases was to act first, and
reflect later. The law had but slender hold, being
respected only when backed by the strong hand, and
primitive instincts were always in the ascendency,
requiring merely a leader to break forth into open
violence. And in this case would there be any lack
of leadership? Like a flash his mind reverted to &ldquo;Black
Bart.&rdquo; There was the man capable of inciting
a mob. If, for some unknown reason, he had sufficient
interest to swear out the warrant and assist in the
arrest, he would have equal cause to serve those fellows
behind him in other ways. Naturally, they would dread
a trial, with its possibility of exposure, and eagerly
grasp any opportunity for wiping the slate clean.
Their real security from discovery undoubtedly lay
in his death, and with the &ldquo;Red Light&rdquo;
crowd behind them they would experience no trouble
in getting a following desperate enough for any purpose.</p>

<p>The longer Keith thought the less he doubted the result.
It was not then a problem of defence, but of escape,
for he believed now that no opportunity to defend
himself would ever be allowed. The arrest was merely
part of the plot intended to leave him helpless in
the hands of the mob. In this Hicks was in no way
blamable--he had merely performed his sworn duty, and
would still die, if need be, in defence of his prisoner.
He was no tool, but only an instrument they had found
means of using.</p>

<p>Keith was essentially a man of action, a fighter by
instinct, and so long accustomed to danger that the
excitement of it merely put new fire into his veins.
Now that he understood exactly what threatened, all
numbing feeling of hesitancy and doubt vanished, and
he became instantly alive. He would not lie there
in that hole waiting for the formation of a mob; nor
would he trust in the ability of the marshal to defend
him.</p>

<p>He had some friends without--not many, for he was
but an occasional visitor at Carson--who would rally
to Hicks&rsquo;s assistance, but there would not be
enough on the side of law and order to overcome the
&ldquo;Red Light&rdquo; outfit, if once they scented
blood. If he was to be saved from their clutches,
he must save himself; if his innocence was ever established
it would be by his own exertions--and he could accomplish
this only out yonder, free under the arch of sky.</p>

<p>He lifted his head, every nerve tingling with desperate
determination. The low growl of voices was audible
through the partition, but there was no other sound.
Carson City was still resting, and there would be no
crowd nor excitement until much later. Not until nightfall
would any attack be attempted; he had six or eight
hours yet in which to perfect his plans. He ran his
eyes about the room searching for some spot of weakness.
It was dark back of the bench, and he turned in that
direction. Leaning over, he looked down on the figure
of a man curled up, sound asleep on the floor. The
fellow&rsquo;s limbs twitched as if in a dream, otherwise
he might have deemed him dead, as his face was buried
in his arms. A moment Keith hesitated; then he reached
down and shook the sleeper, until he aroused sufficiently
to look up. It was the face of a coal-black negro.
An instant the fellow stared at the man towering over
him, his thick lips parted, his eyes full of sudden
terror. Then he sat up, with hands held before him
as though warding off a blow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo; de Lawd&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he managed
to articulate finally, &ldquo;am dis sho&rsquo; yo&rsquo;,
Massa Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith, to whom all colored people were much alike,
laughed at the expression on the negro&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon yer guessed the name, all right, boy.
Were you the cook of the Diamond L?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sah, I nebber cooked no di&rsquo;onds.
I&rsquo;se ol&rsquo; Neb, sah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah, I&rsquo;se de boy dat libbed wid
ol&rsquo; Missus Caton durin&rsquo; de wah. I ain&rsquo;t
seen yo&rsquo;, Massa Jack, sence de day we buried
yo&rsquo; daddy, ol&rsquo; Massa Keith. But I knowed
yo&rsquo; de berry minute I woke up. Sho&rsquo;, yo&rsquo;
&rsquo;members Neb, sah?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It came to Keith now in sudden rush of memory--the
drizzling rain in the little cemetery, the few neighbors
standing about, a narrow fringe of slaves back of
them, the lowering of the coffin, and the hollow sound
of earth falling on the box; and Neb, his Aunt Caton&rsquo;s
house servant, a black imp of good humor, who begged
so hard to be taken back with him to the war. Why,
the boy had held his stirrup the next morning when
he rode away. The sudden rush of recollection seemed
to bridge the years, and that black face became familiar,
a memory of home.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I remember, Neb,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
eagerly, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s all years ago and
I never expected to see you again. What brought you
West and got you into this hole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The negro hitched up onto the bench, the whites of
his eyes conspicuous as he stared uneasily about--he
had a short, squatty figure, with excessively broad
shoulders, and a face of intense good humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reck&rsquo;n dat am consider&rsquo;ble ob
a story, Massa Jack, de circumlocution ob which would
take a heap ob time tellin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he began
soberly. &ldquo;But it happened &lsquo;bout dis away.
When de Yankees come snoopin&rsquo; long de East Sho&rsquo;--I reck&rsquo;n maybe it des a yeah after dat time when
we done buried de ol&rsquo; Co&rsquo;nel--dey burned
Missus Caton&rsquo;s house clah to de groun&rsquo;;
de ol&rsquo; Missus was in Richmond den, an&rsquo;
de few niggers left jest natchally took to de woods.
I went into Richmond huntin&rsquo; de ol&rsquo; Missus,
but, Lawd, Massa Jack, I nebber foun&rsquo; nuthin&rsquo;
ob her in dat crowd. Den an&rsquo; officer man done
got me, an&rsquo; put me diggin&rsquo; in de trenches.
Ef dat&rsquo;s what wah am, I sho&rsquo; don&rsquo;
want no mo&rsquo; wah. Den after dat I jest natchally
drifted. I reckon I libbed &lsquo;bout eberywhar yo&rsquo;
ebber heard ob, fo&rsquo; dar want no use ob me goin&rsquo;
back to de East Sho&rsquo;. Somebody said dat de West
am de right place fo&rsquo; a nigger, an&rsquo; so
I done headed west.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped his face in his black hands, and was silent
for some minutes, but Keith said nothing, and finally
the thick voice continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell yo&rsquo;, Massa Jack, it was mighty
lonely fo&rsquo; Neb dem days. I didn&rsquo;t know
whar any ob yo&rsquo; all was, an&rsquo; it wan&rsquo;t
no fun fo&rsquo; dis nigger bein&rsquo; free dat away.
I got out ter Independence, Missouri, an&rsquo; was
roustaboutin&rsquo; on de ribber, when a coupple ob
men come along what wanted a cook to trabbel wid &rsquo;em.
I took de job, an&rsquo; dat&rsquo;s what fetched me
here ter Carson City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what caused your arrest?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A conjunction ob circumstances, Massa Jack;
yes, sah, a conjunction ob circumstances. I got playin&rsquo;
pokah ober in dat &lsquo;Red Light,&rsquo; an&rsquo;
I was doin&rsquo; fine. I reckon I&rsquo;d cleaned
up mo&rsquo;n a hundred dollars when I got sleepy,
an&rsquo; started fo&rsquo; camp. I&rsquo;d most got
dar w&rsquo;en a bunch ob low white trash jumped me.
It made me mad, it did fo&rsquo; a fact, an&rsquo;
I reckon I carved some ob &rsquo;em up befo&rsquo;
I got away. Ennyhow, de marshal come down, took me
out ob de tent, an&rsquo; fetched me here, an&rsquo;
I ben here ebber sence. I wan&rsquo;t goin&rsquo;
ter let no low down white trash git all dat money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What became of the men you were working for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon dey went on, sah. Dey had &lsquo;portent
business, an&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t likely wait &lsquo;roun&rsquo;
here jest ter help a nigger. Ain&rsquo;t ennybody ben
here ter see me, no-how, an&rsquo; I &rsquo;spects
I&rsquo;se eradicated from dey mem&rsquo;ry--I &rsquo;spects
I is.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_V"></a>Chapter V</h1>

<h2>The One Way</h2>

<p>Keith said nothing for some moments, staring up at
the light stealing in through the window grating,
his mind once again active. The eyes of the black
man had the patient look of a dog as they watched;
evidently he had  cast aside all responsibility, now
that this other had come. Finally Keith spoke slowly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are in much the same position, Neb, and
the fate of one is liable to be the fate of both.
This is my story&rdquo;--and briefly as possible, he
ran over the circumstances which had brought him there,
putting the situation clear enough for the negro&rsquo;s
understanding, without wasting any time upon detail.
Neb followed his recital with bulging eyes, and an
occasional exclamation. At the end he burst forth:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; say dar was two ob dem white men
murdered--one an ol&rsquo; man wid a gray beard, an&rsquo;
de odder &lsquo;bout thirty? Am dat it, Massa Jack,
an&rsquo; dey had fo&rsquo; span ob mules, an&rsquo;
a runnin&rsquo; hoss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; how far out was it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About sixty miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, de good Lawdl&rdquo; and the negro threw
up his hands dramatically. &ldquo;Dat sutt&rsquo;nly
am my outfit! Dat am Massa Waite an&rsquo; John Sibley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the same men with whom you came here
from Independence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb nodded, overcome by the discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what caused them to run such a risk?&rdquo;
Keith insisted. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t they know the
Indians were on the war path?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo;; I heard &rsquo;em talkin&rsquo;
&lsquo;bout dat, but Massa Waite was jest boun&rsquo;
foh to git movin&rsquo;. He didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;pear
to be &rsquo;fraid ob no Injuns; reck&rsquo;ned dey&rsquo;d
nebber stop him, dat he knowed ebbery chief on de plains.
I reck&rsquo;n dat he did, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what was he so anxious to get away for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno, Massa, I done heerd &rsquo;em talk
some &lsquo;bout dey plans, an&rsquo; &rsquo;bout
some gal dey wanted ter fin&rsquo;, but I didn&rsquo;t
git no right sense to it. De Gin&rsquo;ral, he was
a mighty still man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The General? Whom do you mean? Not Waite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;John Sibley done called him dat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Keith remembered--just a dim, misty thread at
first, changing slowly into a clear recollection.
He was riding with despatches from Longstreet to Stonewall
Jackson, and had been shot through the side. The first
of Jackson&rsquo;s troops he reached was a brigade
of North Carolinians, commanded by General Waite--General
Willis Waite. He had fallen from his horse at the
outposts, was brought helpless to the General&rsquo;s
tent, and another sent on with the papers. And Mrs.
Waite had dressed and bandaged his wound. That was
where he had seen that woman&rsquo;s face before, with
its haunting familiarity. He drew the locket from
beneath his shirt, and gazed at the countenance revealed,
with new intelligence. There could be no doubt--it
was the face of her who had cared for him so tenderly
in that tent at Manassas before the fever came and
he had lost consciousness. And that, then, was Willis
Waite lying in that shallow grave near the Cimmaron
Crossing, and for whose death he had been arrested.
&rsquo;T was a strange world, and a small one. What
a miserable ending to a life like his--a division
commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, a Lieutenant-Governor
of his State. What strange combination of circumstances
could ever have brought such a man to this place,
and sent him forth across those Indian-scouted plains?
Surely nothing ordinary. And why should those border
desperadoes have followed, through sixty miles of desolation,
to trike him down? It was not robbery, at least in
the ordinary sense. What then? And how was &ldquo;Black
Bart&rdquo; involved? Why should he be sufficiently
interested to swear out a warrant, and then assist
in his arrest? There must be something to all this
not apparent upon the surface--some object, some purpose
shrouded in mystery. No mere quarrel, no ordinary feud,
no accident of meeting, no theory of commonplace robbery,
would account for the deed, or for the desperate efforts
now being made to conceal it.</p>

<p>Some way, these questions, thus surging upon him,
became a call to live, to fight, to unravel their
mystery. The memory of that sweet-faced woman who
had bent above him when the fever began its mastery,
appealed to him now with the opportunity of service.
He might be able to clear this, bring to her the truth,
save her from despair, and hand over to justice the
murderers of her husband. It was up to him alone to
accomplish this--no one else knew what he knew, suspected
what he suspected. And there was but one way--through
escape. To remain there in weak surrender to fate could
have but one ending, and that swift and sudden. He
had no doubt as to  &ldquo;Black Bart&rsquo;s&rdquo;
purpose, or of his ability to use the &ldquo;Red Light&rdquo;
outfit as desired. The whole plan was clearly evident,
and there would be no delay in execution--all they
were waiting for was night, and a lax guard. He glanced
about at the walls of the room, his eyes grown hard,
his teeth clenched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neb,&rdquo; he said shortly, &ldquo;I guess
that was your outfit all right, but they were not
killed by Indians. They were run down by a gang from
this town-- the same fellows who have put you and
me in here. I don&rsquo;t know what they were after--that&rsquo;s
to be found out later,--but the fight you put up at
the camp spoiled their game for once, and led to your
arrest. They failed to get what was wanted in Carson,
and so they trailed the party to the Cimmaron Crossing.
Then I got on their track, and fearing the result,
they&rsquo;ve landed me also. Now they &rsquo;ll get
rid of us both as best they can. These fellows won&rsquo;t
want any trial--that would be liable to give the whole
trick away--but they have got to put us where we won&rsquo;t
talk. There is an easy way to do this, and that is
by a lynching bee. Do you get my drift, Neb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whites of the negro&rsquo;s eyes were very much
in evidence, his hands gripping at the bench on which
he sat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo; de Lawd, yes, Massa Jack, I sho&rsquo;
does. I corroborates de whole thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are willing to take a chance with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willin&rsquo;! Why, Massa Jack, I&rsquo;se
overjoyed; I ain&rsquo;t gwine leave yer no mo&rsquo;.
I&rsquo;se sho&rsquo; gwine ter be yo&rsquo; nigger.
What yo&rsquo; gwine ter do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith ran his eyes over the walls, carefully noting
every peculiarity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remain here quietly just as long
as it is daylight, Neb,&rdquo; he replied finally,
&ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll try every board and every log
to discover some way out. Just the moment it grows
dark enough to slip away without being seen we&rsquo;ve
got to hit the prairie. Once south of the Arkansas
we&rsquo;re safe, but not until then. Have you made
any effort to get out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The negro came over to him, and bent down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was layin&rsquo; on a board what I&rsquo;d
worked loose at one end,&rdquo; he whispered hoarsely,
&ldquo;back ob de bench, but I couldn&rsquo;t jerk
it out wid&rsquo;out somethin&rsquo; ter pry it up
wid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right yere, Massa Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a heavy twelve-inch plank, part of the flooring,
and the second from the side-wall. Keith managed to
get a grip next to the black fingers, and the two
pressed it up far enough for the white man to run one
arm through the opening up to his shoulder and grope
about below.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a two-foot space there,&rdquo;
he reported, as they let the board settle silently
down into position. &ldquo;The back part of this building
must be set up on piles. I reckon we could pry that
plank up with the bench, Neb, but it&rsquo;s liable
to make considerable racket. Let&rsquo;s hunt about
first for some other weak spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They crept across the floor, testing each separate
board, but without discovering a place where they
could exert a leverage. The thick planks were tightly
spiked down. Nor did the walls offer any better encouragement.
Keith lifted himself to the grated window, getting
a glimpse of the world without, but finding the iron
immovable, the screws solidly imbedded in the outside
wood. He dropped to the floor, feeling baffled and
discouraged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will have to be the plank back of the bench,
Neb,&rdquo; he announced briefly, wiping the perspiration
from his face. &ldquo;Get down there, and work it
as loose as you can without making any noise, while
I keep my ear to the door and listen for any interruption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They took turns at this labor, discovering a loose
nail which gave an opening purchase at the crack,
thus enabling the insertion of a small wooden block,
and insuring space for a good finger grip when the
right time came. A sleepy Mexican brought in their
dinner, and set it down on the bench without a word,
but on his return with supper, the marshal accompanied
him, and remained while they ate, talking to Keith,
and staring about the room. Fortunately, the single
window was to the west, and the last rays of the sun
struck the opposite wall, leaving the space behind
the bench in deep shadow. Whatever might be the plans
of &ldquo;Black Bart&rdquo; and his cronies, Keith
was soon convinced they were unknown to Hicks, who
had evidently been deceived into thinking that this
last arrest had created no excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we picked yer up so early,&rdquo;
he explained, genially. &ldquo;Bart said if we got
to yer afore the boys woke up they&rsquo;d never hear
nuthin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout it, an&rsquo; so thar wouldn&rsquo;t
be no row. He didn&rsquo;t even think thar&rsquo;d
be enny need o&rsquo; keepin&rsquo; a special guard
ter-night, but I reckon I won&rsquo;t take no such
chance as that, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have a couple
o&rsquo; deputies prowlin&rsquo; &rsquo;round fer
luck. When Carson does wake up, she&rsquo;s hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He left them tobacco and pipes, and went away evidently
convinced that he had performed his full duty. The
two prisoners, puffing smoke-rings into the air, heard
the heavy clang of the iron bar falling into place
across the door, and sat looking into one another&rsquo;s
faces through the deepening twilight. In the mind
of both blaik and white reposed the same thought.
The negro was first to break the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pears ter me, Massa Jack, like dis yere
Bart pusson am mighty anxious ter hab no suspicions
raised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody but Hicks would see that,&rdquo; acknowledged
the other, the rings of smoke circling his head, &ldquo;but
he hasn&rsquo;t any brains. It was pure nerve that
got him the job. Well, this is one time that &lsquo;Bart
pusson&rsquo; is going to find an empty coop. We&rsquo;ll
get out, Neb, just as soon as it gets dark enough.
Hicks isn&rsquo;t likely to put on his extra guard
for an hour yet, and the &lsquo;Red Light&rsquo; bunch
won&rsquo;t be fit for business much before midnight.
By that time we&rsquo;ll be in the sand hills, heading
south, able to give them a run for their money--we&rsquo;ll
have horses, too, if we can find them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The negro&rsquo;s eyes shone white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo; de Lawd&rsquo;s sake, Massa,&rdquo;
he protested, &ldquo;dat&rsquo;d sho&rsquo; be a hangin&rsquo;
job if ebber dey cotched us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith laughed, knocking out the ashes from his pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With an hour&rsquo;s start that will be the
least of my troubles,&rdquo; he said, quietly.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_VI"></a>Chapter VI</h1>

<h2>The Escape</h2>

<p>It was dark enough for their purpose in half an hour,
the only gleam of remaining color being the red glow
of the negro&rsquo;s pipe, even the openings in the
iron grating being blotted from sight. Keith, staring
in that direction, failed to perceive any distant
glimmer of star, and decided the night must be cloudy,
and that time for action had come. Guided by Neb&rsquo;s
pipe bowl, he touched the boy on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knock out your ashes, and shuffle about lively
with your feet, while I pry up the board.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of his slenderness, Keith possessed unusual
strength, yet no exertion on his part served to start
the loosened plank sufficiently for their purpose.
Ripping a strip from the bench he managed to pry the
hole somewhat larger, arranging the bench itself so
as to afford the necessary leverage, but even then
his entire weight failed to either start the spikes,
or crack the plank. Some altercation began in the other
room, the sound of angry voices and shuffling feet
being plainly audible. It was clear to Keith that
they must take the chance of a noise, and no better
time than this could be chosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Neb, take hold with me, and bear down--put
your whole weight on it, boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two flung themselves upon the end of the bench
leaping up and down so as to add weight to power.
Something had to give, either the stout wood of their
improvised lever or else the holding of the plank.
For an instant it seemed likely to be the former;
then, with a shrill screech, the long spikes yielded
and the board suddenly gave. With shoulders inserted
beneath, the two men heaved it still higher, ramming
the bench below so as to leave the opening clear.
This was now sufficiently ample for the passage of
a man&rsquo;s body, and Keith, lowering himself, discovered
the earth to be fully four feet below. The negro instantly
joined him, and they began creeping about in the darkness,
seeking some way out. A rudely laid foundation of
limestone alone obstructed their path to the open air.
This had been laid in mortar, but of inferior quality,
so that little difficulty was experienced in detaching
sufficient to obtain hand hold. Working silently,
not knowing what watchers might be already stationed
without, they succeeded in loosening enough of the
rock to allow them to crawl through, lying breathless
in the open. Accustomed as they were to the darkness,
they could yet see little. They were upon the opposite
side from the town, with no gleam of lights visible,
prairie and sky blending together into spectral dimness,
with no sound audible but the continued quarrel in
the front room of the jail. Keith crept along to the
end of the  building from where he could perceive
the lights of the town twinkling dimly through the
intense blackness. Evidently the regular evening saturnalia
had not yet begun, although there was already semblance
of life about the numerous saloons, and an occasional
shout punctuated the stillness. A dog howled in the
distance, and the pounding of swift hoofs along the
trail told of fresh arrivals. An hour later and the
single street of Carson City would be alive with humanity,
eager for any excitement, ready for any wild orgy,
if only once turned loose. That it would be turned
loose, and also directed, the man lying on his face
in the grass felt fully assured. He smiled grimly,
wishing he might behold &ldquo;Black Bart&rsquo;s&rdquo;
face when he should discover the flight of his intended
victims. But there was no time to lose; every moment
gained, added to their chance of safety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are those horses tied there by the blacksmith&rsquo;s
shop?&rdquo; he asked, pointing.</p>

<p>The negro stared in the direction indicated, confused
by the shadows thrown by the dim lights.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reck&rsquo;n dey am, Massa Jack; I done make
out fo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then two of them must belong to us; come on,
boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ran forward, crouching behind every chance cover,
and keeping well back behind the line of shacks. A
slight depression in the prairie helped conceal their
movements, and neither spoke until they were crouching
together beside the wall of the shop. Then Neb, teeth
chattering, managed to blurt forth:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo; de Lawd&rsquo;s sake, yer don&rsquo;t
actually mean ter steal dem hosses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith glanced about at the other&rsquo;s dim, black
shadow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not; just borrow &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But dat&rsquo;s a hangin&rsquo; job in dis
yere country, Massa Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure it is if they catch us. But we&rsquo;d
be strung up anyway, and we can&rsquo;t be hung twice.
Besides there is a chance for us with the ponies, and
none at all without. An hour&rsquo;s start in the
saddle, Neb, and this bunch back here will never even
find our trail; I pledge you that. Come, boy, stay
close with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was the quiet, confident voice of assured command,
of one satisfied with his plans, and the obedient
negro, breathing hard, never dreamed of opposition;
all instincts of slavery held him to the dominion of
this white master. Keith leaned forward, staring at
the string of deserted ponies tied to the rail. Success
depended on his choice, and he could judge very little
in that darkness. Men were straggling in along the
street to their right, on foot and horseback, and the
saloon on the corner was being well patronized. A
glow of light streamed forth from its windows, and
there was the sound of many voices. But this narrow
alley was deserted, and black. The fugitive stepped
boldly forward, afraid that otherwise he might startle
the ponies and thus create an alarm. Guided by a horseman&rsquo;s
instinct he swiftly ran his hands over the animals,
and made quick selection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Neb, take this fellow; lead him quietly
down the bank,&rdquo; and he thrust the loosened rein
into the black&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>An instant later he had chosen his own mount, and
was silently moving in the same direction, although
the night there was so black that the obedient negro
had already entirely vanished. The slope of the land
not only helped cover their movements, but also rendered
it easy for them to find one another. Fully a hundred
yards westward they met, where a gully led directly
down toward the river. There was no longer need for
remaining on foot, as they were a sufficient distance
away from the little town to feel no fear of being
discovered, unless by some drunken straggler. At Keith&rsquo;s
command the negro climbed into his saddle. Both ponies
were restive, but not vicious, and after a plunge
or two, to test their new masters, came easily under
control. Keith led the way, moving straight down the
gully, which gradually deepened, burying them in its
black heart, until it finally debouched onto the river
sands. The riotous noises of the drunken town died
slowly away behind, the night silent and dark. The
two riders could scarcely distinguish one another
as they drew rein at the edge of the water. To the
southward there gleamed a cluster of lights, marking
the position of the camp of regulars. Keith drove his
horse deeper into the stream, and headed northward,
the negro following like a shadow.</p>

<p>There was a ford directly opposite the cantonment,
and another, more dangerous, and known to only a few,
three miles farther up stream. Keeping well within
the water&rsquo;s edge, so as to thus completely obscure
their trail, yet not daring to venture deep for fear
of striking quicksand, the plainsman sent his pony
struggling forward, until the dim outline of the bank
at his right rendered him confident that they had attained
the proper point for crossing. He had been that way
only once before, and realized the danger of attempting
passage in such darkness, but urgent need drove him
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Follow me just as close as you can, boy,&rdquo;
he said sternly, &ldquo;and keep both your feet out
of the stirrups. If your horse goes down hang to is
tail, and let him swim out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was little enough to guide by, merely a single
faint star peering out from a rift of the clouds,
but Keith&rsquo;s remembrance was that the ford led
straight out to the centre of the stream, and then
veered slightly toward the right. He knew the sand
ridge was only used by horsemen, not being wide enough
for the safe passage of wagons, but the depth of the
water on either side was entirely problematical. He
was taking a big  chance, yet dare not wait for daylight.
Summoning all his nerve and alertness, he urged his
horse slowly forward, the intelligent animal seemingly
comprehending the situation, and feeling carefully
for footing. The actions of the animal gave the rider
greater confidence, and he loosened his grip on the
rein, leaving the pony&rsquo;s instinct to control.
The latter fairly crept forward, testing the sand
before resting any weight upon the hoof, the negro&rsquo;s
mount following closely. The water was unusually high,
and as they advanced it bore down against them in
considerable volume; then, as they veered to the right,
they were compelled to push directly against its weight
in struggling toward shore. The men could see nothing
but this solid sheet of water rushing down toward
them from out the black void, and then vanishing below.
Once Keith&rsquo;s horse half fell, plunging nose
under, yet gaining foothold again before the rider
had deserted his saddle. A dim blackness ahead already
revealed the nearness of the southern bank, when Neb&rsquo;s
pony went down suddenly, swept fairly off its legs
by some fierce eddy in the stream. Keith heard the
negro&rsquo;s guttural cry, and caught a glimpse of
him as the two were sent whirling down. The coiled
rope of the lariat, grasped in his right hand, was
hurled forth like a shot, but came back empty. Not
another sound reached him; his own horse went steadily
on, feeling his way, until he was nose against the
bank, with water merely rippling about his ankles.
Keith driving feet again into the stirrups headed him
down stream, wading close in toward the shore, leaning
forward over the pommel striving to see through the
gloom.</p>

<p>He had no doubt about Neb&rsquo;s pony making land,
unless struck by some driftwood, or borne to the centre
of the stream by the shifting force of the current.
But if Neb had failed to retain his grip he might have
been sucked under by the surge of waters. A hundred
yards below he found them, dripping and weak from
the struggle, yet otherwise unhurt. There were no
words spoken, but black and white hands clasped silently,
and then Neb crept back into the saddle, shivering
in his wet clothes as the cool night wind swept against
him. Keeping close in toward shore, yet far enough
out so that the water would hide their trail, the
fugitives toiled steadily up stream, guided only by
the black outline of the low bank upon their left.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_VII"></a>Chapter VII</h1>

<h2>In the Sand Desert</h2>

<p>Suddenly Keith halted, bringing his pony&rsquo;s head
sharply about, so that the two faced one another.
The wind was rising, hurling clouds of sand into their
eyes, and the plainsman held one hand before his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need of keeping up a water
trail any longer,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;By
all the signs we&rsquo;re in for a sand storm by daylight,
and that will cover our tracks so the devil himself
couldn&rsquo;t follow them. Got a water bag on your
saddle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reck&rsquo;n dis am one, sah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith felt of the object Neb held forth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a big one, too; fill it and strap
it on tight; we&rsquo;ve got a long, dry ride ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whar&rsquo; yo&rsquo; propose goin&rsquo;,
Massa Jack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the &lsquo;Bar X&rsquo; on the Canadian.
I&rsquo;ve worked with that outfit. They&rsquo;ll
give us whatever we need, and ask no questions; I don&rsquo;t
know of anything in between. It&rsquo;s going to be
a hard ride, boy, and mighty little to eat except
what I saved from supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How far am it to dis yere &rsquo;Bar X&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A hundred and fifty miles as the crow flies,
and sand all the way, except for the valley of Salt
Fork. Come on now, and keep close, for it&rsquo;s easy
to get lost in these sand hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith had ridden that hundred and fifty miles of sandy
desolation before, but had never been called upon
to make such a journey as this proved to be. He knew
there was little to fear from human enemies, for they
were riding far enough east of the Santa F&eacute; trail
to be out of the path of raiding parties, while this
desert country was shunned by Indian hunters. It consisted
of sand hill after sand hill, a drear waterless waste
where nothing grew, and amid the dread sameness of
which a traveller could only find passage by the guidance
of stars at night or the blazing sun by day. To the
eye mile after mile appeared exactly alike, with nothing
whatever to distinguish either distance or direction--the
same drifting ridges of sand stretching forth in every
direction, no summit higher than another, no semblance
of green shrubbery, or silver sheen of running water
anywhere to break the dull monotony--a vast sandy
plain, devoid of life, extending to the horizon, overhung
by a barren sky.</p>

<p>They had covered ten miles of it by daybreak, their
ponies travelling heavily, fetlock deep, but could
advance no further. With the first tint of rose in
the east the brooding storm burst upon them in wild
desert fury, the fierce wind buffeting them back,
lashing their faces with sharp grit until they were
unable to bear the pain. The flying sand smote them
in clouds, driven with the speed of bullets. In vain
they lay flat, urging their ponies forward; the beasts,
maddened and blinded by the merciless lashing of the
sand, refused to face the storm. Keith, all sense of
direction long since lost, rolled wearily from the
saddle, burrowed under the partial shelter of a sand
dune, and called upon Neb to follow him. With their
hands and feet they made a slight wind-break, dragging
the struggling ponies into its protection, and burrowed
themselves there, the clouds of sand skurrying over
them so thick as to obscure the sky, and rapidly burying
them altogether as though in a grave. Within an hour
they were compelled to dig themselves out, yet it
proved partial escape from the pitiless lashing. The
wind howled like unloosed demons, and the air grew
cold, adding to the sting of the grit, when some sudden
eddy hurled it into their hiding place. To endeavor
further travel would mean certain death, for no one
could have guided a course for a hundred feet through
the tempest, which seemed to suck the very breath away.
To the fugitives came this comfort--if they could
not advance, then no one else could follow, and the
storm was completely blotting out their trail.</p>

<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock before it died sufficiently
down for them to venture out. Even then the air remained
full of sand, while constantly shifting ridges made
travel difficult. Only grim necessity--the suffering
of the ponies for water, and their own need for soon
reaching the habitation of man and acquiring food--drove
them to the early venture. They must attain the valley
of the Salt Fork that night, or else perish in the
desert-- there remained no other choice. Tying neckerchiefs
over their horses&rsquo; eyes, and lying flat themselves,
they succeeded in pressing slowly forward, winding
in and out among the shifting dunes, with only the
wind to guide them. It was an awful trail, the hoofs
sinking deep in drifting sand, the struggling ponies
becoming so exhausted that their riders finally dismounted,
and staggered forward on foot, leading them stumbling
blindly after. Once the negro&rsquo;s horse dropped,
and had to be lashed to its feet again; once Keith&rsquo;s
pony stumbled and fell on him, hurling him face down
into the sand, and he would have died there, lacking
sufficient strength to lift the dead weight, but for
Neb&rsquo;s assistance. As it was he went staggering
blindly forward, bruised, and faint from hunger and
fatigue. Neither man spoke; they had no breath nor
energy left to waste; every ounce of strength needed
to be conserved for the battle against nature. They
were fighting for life; fighting grimly, almost hopelessly,
and alone.</p>

<p>About them night finally closed in, black and starless,
yet fortunately with a gradual dying away of the storm.
For an hour past they had been struggling on, doubting
their direction, wondering dully if they were not
lost and merely drifting about in a circle. They had
debated this fiercely once, the ponies standing dejectedly,
tails to the storm, Neb arguing that the wind still
blew from the south, and Keith contending it had shifted
into the westward. The white man won his way, and they
staggered on uncertain, the negro grasping the first
pony&rsquo;s tail to keep from being separated from
his companion. Some instinct of the plains must have
guided them, for at last they dragged themselves out
from the desert, the crunching sand under foot changing
into rock, and then to short brittle grass, at which
the ponies nibbled eagerly. The slope led gradually
downward, the animals scenting water, and struggling
to break away. Swaying in their saddles, the riders
let them go, and they never stopped until belly deep
in the stream, their noses buried. The men shivered
in their saddles, until, at last satisfied, the ponies
consented to be forced back up the bank, where they
nibbled at the short tufts of herbage, but in a manner
expressive of weariness. Keith flung himself on the
ground, every muscle of his body aching, his exposed
flesh still smarting from the hail of sand through
which they had passed.</p>

<p>He had not the slightest conception as to where they
were, except he knew this must be the Salt Fork. Utterly
confused by the maze of shifting dunes, through whose
intricacies they had somehow found passage, the blackness
of the night yielded no clue as to their point of emergence.
The volume of water in the stream alone suggested
that in their wanderings they must have drifted to
the eastward, and come out much lower down than had
been originally intended. If so, then they might be
almost directly south of Carson City, and in a section
with which he was totally unacquainted. One thing
was, however, certain--they would be compelled to
wait for daylight to ascertain the truth, and decide
upon their future movements. There was another barren,
sandy stretch of desolation lying between this isolated
valley and that of the Canadian, and their horses
would never stand to be pushed forward without both
rest and food. As to themselves--they had eaten their
last crumb long since, but this was not the first
time both had known starvation.</p>

<p>Keith arose reluctantly, and removed the saddles from
the animals, hobbling them so they could graze at
will. Neb was propped up beneath an out-cropping of
the bank, which partly protected him from the wind,
a mere hulk of a shadow. Keith could not tell whether
he slept or not, but made no effort to disturb him.
A moment he stared vacantly about into the black silence,
and then lay down, pillowing his head upon a saddle.
He found it impossible to sleep, the chill of the
wind causing him to turn and twist, in vain search
after comfort, while unappeased hunger gnawed incessantly.
His eyes ranged about over the dull gloom of the skies
until they fell again to the earth level, and then
he suddenly sat up, half believing himself in a dream--down
the stream, how far away he could not judge, there
gleamed a steady, yellowish light. It was no flicker
of a camp fire, yet remained stationary. Surely no
star could be so low and large; nor did he recall
any with that peculiarity of color. If such a miracle
was possible in the heart of that sandy desert he
would have sworn it was a lamp shining through a window.
But he had never heard of any settler on the Salt
Fork, and almost laughed at the thought, believing
for the instant his brain played him some elfish trick.
Yet that light was no illusion; he rubbed his eyes,
only to see it more clearly, convinced now of its
reality. He strode hastily across, and shook Neb into
semi-consciousness, dragging him bodily up the bank
and pointing down stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo; he inquired anxiously.
&ldquo;There, straight ahead of you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The negro stared, shaking with cold, and scarcely
able to stand alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it am de moon, Massa Jack,&rdquo; he
muttered thickly, &ldquo;or a goblin&rsquo;s lantern.
Lawd, I don&rsquo;t jest like de looks ob dat ting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; and Keith laughed uneasily
at the negro&rsquo;s fears. &ldquo;All I wanted to
know was if you saw what I saw. That&rsquo;s a lamp
shining through a window, Neb. What in heaven&rsquo;s
name it can be doing here I am unable to guess, but
I&rsquo;m going to find out. It means shelter and food,
boy, even if we have to fight for it. Come on, the
horses are safe, and we&rsquo;ll discover what is
behind that light yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_VIII"></a>Chapter VIII</h1>

<h2>The Wilderness Cabin</h2>

<p>The light was considerably farther away than they
had at first supposed, and as they advanced steadily
toward it, the nature of the ground rapidly changed,
becoming irregular, and littered with low growing shrubs.
In the darkness they stumbled over outcroppings of
rock, and after a fall or two, were compelled to move
forward with extreme caution. But the mysterious yellow
glow continually beckoned, and with new hope animating
the hearts of both men, they staggered on, nerving
themselves to the effort, and following closely along
the bank of the stream.</p>

<p>At last they arrived where they could perceive dimly
something of the nature of this unexpected desert
oasis.</p>

<p>The light shone forth, piercing the night, through
the uncurtained window of a log cabin, which would
otherwise have been completely concealed from view
by a group of low growing cottonwoods. This was all
the black, enshrouding night revealed, and even this
was merely made apparent by the yellow illumination
of the window. The cabin stood upon an island, a strip
of sand, partially covered by water, separating it
from the north shore on which they stood. There was
no sign of life about the hut, other than the burning
lamp, but that alone was sufficient evidence of occupancy.
In spite of hunger, and urgent need, Keith hesitated,
uncertain as to what they might be called upon to
face. Who could be living in this out-of-the-way
spot, in the heart of this inhospitable desert? It
would be no cattle outpost surely, for there was no
surrounding grazing land, while surely no professional
hunter would choose such a barren spot for headquarters.
Either a hermit, anxious to escape all intercourse
with humanity, or some outlaw hiding from arrest,
would be likely to select so isolated a place in which
to live. To them it would be ideal. Away from all trails,
where not even widely roving cattlemen would penetrate,
in midst of a desert avoided by Indians because of
lack of game,--a man might hide here year after year
without danger of discovery. Yet such a one would not
be likely to welcome their coming, and they were without
arms. But Keith was not a man to hesitate long because
of possible danger, and he stepped down into the shallow
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Neb,&rdquo; he commanded, &ldquo;and
we &rsquo;ll find out who lives here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The window faced the west, and he came up the low
bank to where the door fronted the north in intense
darkness. Under the shadow of the cottonwoods he could
see nothing, groping his way, with hands extended.
His foot struck a flat stone, and he plunged forward,
striking the unlatched door so heavily as to swing
it open, and fell partially forward into the room.
As he struggled to his knees, Neb&rsquo;s black face
peering past him into the lighted interior, he seemed
to perceive in one swift, comprehensive glance, every
revealed detail. A lamp burned on a rudely constructed
set of drawers near the window, and a wood fire blazed
redly in a stone fireplace opposite, the yellow and
red lights blending in a peculiar glow of color. Under
this radiance were revealed the rough log walls, plastered
with yellow clay, and hung about with the skins of
wild animals, a roughly made table, bare except for
a book lying upon it, and a few ordinary appearing
boxes, evidently utilized as seats, together with a
barrel cut so as to make a comfortable chair. In the
back wall was a door, partially open, apparently leading
into a second room. That was all, except the woman.</p>

<p>Keith must have perceived all these in that first
hurried glance, for they were ever after closely associated
together in his mind, yet at the moment he possessed
no clear thought of anything except her. She stood
directly behind the table, where she must have sprung
hastily at the first sound of their approach, clutching
at the rude mantel above the fireplace, and staring
toward him, her face white, her breath coming in sobs.
At first he thought the vision a dream, a delirium
born from his long struggle; he could not conceive
the possibility of such a presence in this lonely
place, and staggering to his feet, gazed wildly, dumbly
at the slender, gray clad figure, the almost girlish
face under the shadowing dark hair, expecting the
marvellous vision to vanish. Surely this could not
be real! A woman, and such a woman as this here, and
alone, of all places! He staggered from weakness,
almost terror, and grasped the table to hold himself
erect. The rising wind came swirling in through the
open door, causing the fire to send forth spirals
of smoke, and he turned, dragging the dazed negro
within, and snapping the latch behind him. When he
glanced around again he fully believed the vision
confronting him would have vanished. But no! there
she yet remained, those wide-open, frightened brown
eyes, with long lashes half hiding their depths, looking
directly into his own; only now she had slightly changed
her posture, leaning toward him across the table.
Like a flash he comprehended that this was reality--flesh
and blood--and, with the swift instinct of a gentleman,
his numbed, nerveless fingers jerked off his hat,
and he bowed bareheaded before her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he said, finding his voice
with difficulty. &ldquo;I fell over the step, but--but
I didn&rsquo;t expect to find a woman here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He heard her quick breathing, marked a slight change
in the expression of the dark eyes, and caught the
glitter of the firelight on a revolver in her lowered
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you expect to find?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly knew,&rdquo; he explained lamely;
&ldquo;we stumbled on this hut by accident. I didn&rsquo;t
know there was a cabin in all this valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are not here for any purpose? to meet
with any one?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we were lost, and had gone into camp up
above, when we discovered your light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith hesitated just an instant, yet falsehood was
never easy for him, and he saw no occasion for any
deceit now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Carson City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We started for the &lsquo;Bar X&rsquo; Ranch
down below, on the Canadian; got caught in a sand-storm,
and then just drifted. I do not know within twenty
miles of where we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew a deep breath of unconcealed relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The negro and I--yes; and you haven&rsquo;t
the slightest reason to be afraid of us--we&rsquo;re
square.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly, and something in Keith&rsquo;s
clean-cut face seemed to bring reassurance, confidence
in the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; she answered, coming
toward him around the short table. &ldquo;Only it
is so lonely here, and you startled me, bursting in
without warning. But you look all right, and I am
going to believe your story. What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keith--Jack Keith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A cowman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little of everything, I reckon,&rdquo; a
touch of returning bitterness in the tone. &ldquo;A
plainsman, who has punched cattle, but my last job
was government scout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as though you might be more than that,&rdquo;
she said slowly.</p>

<p>The man flushed, his lips pressing tightly together.
&ldquo;Well, I--I may have been,&rdquo; he confessed
unwillingly. &ldquo;I started out all right, but somehow
I reckon I just went adrift. It&rsquo;s a habit in
this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently those first words of comment had left her
lips unthinkingly, for she made no attempt to reply;
merely stood there directly facing him, her clear
eyes gazing frankly into his own. He seemed to actually
see her now for the first time, fairly--a supple,
slender figure, simply dressed, with wonderfully excessive
brown eyes, a perfect wealth of dark hair, a clear
complexion with slight olive tinge to it, a strong,
intelligent face, not strictly beautiful, yet strangely
attractive, the forehead low and broad, the nose straight,
the lips full and inclined to smile. Suddenly a vague
remembrance brought recognition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I know you now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; the single word a note of undisguised
surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I thought you looked oddly familiar all
the time, but couldn&rsquo;t for the life of me connect
up. You&rsquo;re Christie Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; her eyes filled with curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you are. You needn&rsquo;t be afraid
of me if you want it kept secret, but I know you just
the same. Saw you at the &lsquo;Gaiety&rsquo; in Independence,
maybe two months ago. I went three times, mostly on
your account. You&rsquo;ve got a great act, and you
can sing too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood in silence, still looking fixedly at him,
her bosom rising and falling, her lips parted as if
to speak. Apparently she did not know what to do,
how to act, and was thinking swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keith,&rdquo; she said, at last in decision,
&ldquo;I am going to ask you to blot that all out--to
forget that you even suspect me of being Christie
Maclaire, of the Gaiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly; but would you explain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is little enough to explain. It is sufficient
that I am here alone with you. Whether I wish to or
not, I am compelled to trust myself to your protection.
You may call me Christie Maclaire, or anything else
you please; you may even think me unworthy respect,
but you possess the face of a gentleman, and as such
I am going to trust you--I must trust you. Will you
accept my confidence on these terms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith did not smile, nor move. Weak from hunger and
fatigue, he leaned wearily against the wall. Nevertheless
that simple, womanly appeal awoke all that was strong
and sacrificing within him, although her words were
so unexpected that, for the moment, he failed to realize
their full purport. Finally he straightened up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I--I accept any terms you desire,&rdquo; he
gasped weakly, &ldquo;if--if you will only give one
return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One return?--what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Food; we have eaten nothing for sixty hours.&rdquo;
Her face, which had been so white, flushed to the
hair, her dark eyes softening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course; sit down. I ought to have known
from your face. There is plenty here--such as it is--only
you must wait a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_IX"></a>Chapter IX</h1>

<h2>The Girl of the Cabin</h2>

<p>He saw Neb drop down before the blazing fireplace,
and curl up like a tired dog, and observed her take
the lamp, open the door into the other room a trifle,
and slip silently out of sight. He remembered staring
vaguely about the little room, still illumined by the
flames, only half comprehending, and then the reaction
from his desperate struggle with the elements overcame
all resolution, and he dropped his head forward on
the table, and lost consciousness. Her hand upon his
shoulder aroused him, startled into wakefulness, yet
he scarcely realized the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have placed food for the negro beside him,&rdquo;
she said quietly, and for the first time Keith detected
the soft blur in her speech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are from the South!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
as though it was a discovery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes--and you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My boyhood began in Virginia--the negro was
an old-time slave in our family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced across at the black, now sitting up and
eating voraciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought he had once been a slave; one can
easily tell that. I did not ask him to sit here because,
if you do not object, we will eat here together. I
have also been almost as long without food. It was
so lonely here, and--and I hardly understood my situation--and
I simply could not force myself to eat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He distinguished her words clearly enough, although
she spoke low, as if she preferred what was said between
them should not reach the ears of the negro, yet somehow,
for the moment, they made no adequate impression on
him. Like a famished wolf he began on the coarse fare,
and for ten minutes hardly lifted his head. Then his
eyes chanced to meet hers across the narrow table,
and instantly the gentleman within him reawoke to life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been a perfect brute,&rdquo; he acknowledged
frankly, &ldquo;with no thought except for myself.
Hunger was my master, and I ask your forgiveness, Miss
Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am so very glad to have any one here--any
one--in whom I feel even a little confidence--that
nothing else greatly matters. Can you both eat, and
listen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith nodded, his eyes full of interest, searching
her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoever I may be, Mr. Keith, and really that
seems only of small importance, I came to Fort Larned
seeking some trace of my only brother, whom we last
heard from there, where he had fallen into evil companionship.
On the stage trip I was fortunate enough to form an
acquaintance with a man who told me he knew where I
could meet Fred, but that the boy was hiding because
of some trouble he had lately gotten into, and that
I should have to proceed very carefully so as not to
lead the  officers to discover his whereabouts. This
gentleman was engaged in some business at Carson City,
but he employed a man to bring me to this place, and
promised to get Fred, and meet me here the following
day. There must have been some failure in the plans,
for I have been here entirely alone now for three
days. It has been very lonesome, and--and I&rsquo;ve
been a little frightened. Perhaps I ought not to have
come, and I am not certain what kind of a place this
is. I was so afraid when you came, but I am not afraid
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have no need to be,&rdquo; he said soberly,
impressed by the innocent candor of the girl, and
feeling thankful that he was present to aid her. &ldquo;I
could not wrong one of the South.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father always told me I could trust a Southern
gentleman under any circumstance. Mr. Hawley was from
my own State, and knew many of our old friends. That
was why I felt such unusual confidence in him, although
he was but a travelling acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gentleman whom I met on the stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; you said he was in business in Carson
City, but I don&rsquo;t seem to remember any one of
that name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was not there permanently; only to complete
some business deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your brother? I may possibly have known
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated an instant, her eyes dropping, until
completely shaded by the long lashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He--he was rather a wild boy, and ran away
from home to enlist in the army. But he got into a
bad set, and--and deserted. That was part of the trouble
which caused him to hide. He enlisted under the name
of Fred Willoughby. Mr. Hawley told me this much,
but I am afraid he did not tell me all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he said you would meet him here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith gazed about on the bare surroundings wonderingly.
What was this place, hidden away in the midst of the
desert, isolated in a spot where not even Indians
roamed. Could it be a secret rendezvous of crime, the
headquarters of desperadoes, of cattle-rustlers, of
highwaymen of the Santa F&eacute; Trail--a point to which
they could ride when hard pressed, certain of hiding
here in safety? He began to suspect this, but, if so,
who then was this Hawley, and with what object had
he sent this girl here? Every way he turned was to
confront mystery, to face a new puzzle. Whatever she
might be--even the music hall singer he believed--she
had been inveigled here innocently enough. Even now
she possessed only the most vague suspicion that she
had been deceived. The centre of the whole plot, if
there was a plot, must be Hawley.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;he said that
this was one of the stations of a big ranch on which
Fred was employed, and that he would certainly be here
within a day or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You met Hawley on the stage coach? How did
you become acquainted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were alone for nearly fifty miles,&rdquo;
her voice faltering slightly, &ldquo;and--and he called
me what you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Christie Maclaire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; he--he seemed to think he knew me, and
I needed help so much that I let him believe so. I
thought it could do no harm, and then, when I found
he actually knew Fred, I didn&rsquo;t think of anything
else, only how fortunate I was to thus meet him. Surely
something serious must have happened, or he would
have been here before this. Do you--do you suppose
there is anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith did not smile nor change posture. The more he
delved into the matter, the more serious he felt the
situation to be. He knew all those ranches lying south
on the Canadian, and was aware that this was no out-station.
No cattle ever came across that sandy desert unless
driven by rustlers, and no honest purpose could account
for this isolated hut. There had been frequent robberies
along the trail, and he had overheard tales of mysterious
disappearances in both Larned and Carson City. Could
it be that he had now, accidentally, stumbled upon
the rendezvous of the gang? He was not a man easily
startled, but this thought sent his heart beating.
He knew enough to realize what such a gang would naturally
consist of-- deserters, outlaws, rustlers; both Indians
and whites, no doubt, combined under some desperate
leadership. Gazing into the girl&rsquo;s questioning
eyes he could scarcely refrain from blurting out all
he suspected. Yet why should he? What good could it
do? He could not hope to bear her south to the &ldquo;Bar
X&rdquo; Ranch, for the ponies were already too thoroughly
exhausted for such a journey; he dared not turn north
with her, for that would mean his own arrest, leaving
her in worse condition than ever. If he only knew
who this man Hawley was, his purpose, and plans! Yet
what protection could he and Neb prove, alone here,
and without arms? All this flashed through his mind
in an instant, leaving him confused and uncertain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; he managed to say in answer
to her query. &ldquo;But it is rather a strange mix-up
all around, and I confess I fail to comprehend its
full meaning. It is hardly likely your friends will
show up to-night, and by morning perhaps we can decide
what is best to do. Let me look around outside a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes followed him as he stepped through the door
into the darkness; then her head dropped into the
support of her hands. There was silence except for
the crackling of the fire, until Neb moved uneasily.
At the sound the girl looked up, seeing clearly the
good-natured face of the negro.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t nebber need cry, Missus,&rdquo;
he said soberly, &ldquo;so long as Massa Jack done
&rsquo;greed to look after yo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have--have you known him long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has I knowed him long, honey? Ebber sence befo&rsquo;
de wah. Why I done knowed Massa Jack when he wan&rsquo;t
more&rsquo;n dat high. Lawd, he sho&rsquo; was a lively
youngster, but mighty good hearted to us niggers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated to question a servant, and yet felt
she must uncover the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he? Is he all he claims to be--a Virginia
gentleman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the loyalty and pride of slavery days was in Neb.
&ldquo;He sho&rsquo; am, Missus; dar ain&rsquo;t nuthin&rsquo;
higher in ol&rsquo; Virginia dan de Keiths. Dey ain&rsquo;t
got much money sence the Yankees come down dar, but
dey&rsquo;s quality folks jest de same. I was done
born on de ol&rsquo; Co&rsquo;nel&rsquo;s plantation,
and I reck&rsquo;n dar wan&rsquo;t no finer man ebber
libed. He was done killed in de wah. An&rsquo; Massa
Jack he was a captain; he rode on hossback, an&rsquo;
Lawdy, but he did look scrumptuous when he first got
his uniform. He done fought all through de wah, an&rsquo;
dey say Ginral Lee done shook hands wid him, an&rsquo;
said how proud he was ter know him. You kin sutt&rsquo;nly
tie to Massa Jack, Missus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The negro&rsquo;s voice had scarcely ceased when Keith
came in again, closing the door securely behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All quiet outside,&rdquo; he announced, speaking
with new confidence. &ldquo;I wanted to get an understanding
of the surroundings in case of emergency,&rdquo; he
explained, as if in answer to the questioning of the
brown eyes gravely uplifted to his face. &ldquo;I
see there is quite a corral at the lower end of this
island, safely hidden behind the fringe of cottonwoods.
And a log stable back of the house. Is the creek fordable
both ways?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so; the man who brought me here rode
away south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you going to trust yourself to my care?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came around the table with hands extended. He
took them into his grasp, looking down into her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said softly, &ldquo;I am going
to trust you, Captain Keith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain, hey? You must have been talking with
that black rascal there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The swift color flooded her face, but her hands remained
imprisoned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just done tol&rsquo; her who de Keiths was
down in ol&rsquo; Virginia, sah,&rdquo; burst in Neb
indignantly. &ldquo;I sho&rsquo; don&rsquo;t want nobody
to think I go trapsin&rsquo; &rsquo;round wid any
low white trash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gray eyes and the brown, gazing into one another,
smiled with understanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; Keith acknowledged, genially,
&ldquo;I cannot say I am sorry you know something
of my past glories; if one can&rsquo;t have a future,
it is some source of pride to have a past to remember.
But now about the present. We&rsquo;re not much protection
to any one, the way we&rsquo;re fixed, as we are unarmed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a big revolver hanging in a holster
in the other room,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and
a short, sawed-off gun of some kind, but I don&rsquo;t
know about ammunition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May we investigate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; and she threw open the
intervening door. As the two stepped into the other
apartment she held the lamp in aid of their search.
&ldquo;There is the revolver on the wall, and the gun
is in the opposite corner. Isn&rsquo;t it strange
you should be out in this country without arms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith glanced up, the revolver in his hands. The radiance
of the light was full upon her face, revealing the
clearness of her skin, the dark shadows of her lashes.
There was the faintest tinge of suspicion to the question,
but he answered easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We left Carson in something of a hurry. I&rsquo;ll
tell you the story to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_X"></a>Chapter X</h1>

<h2>Mr. Hawley Reveals Himself</h2>

<p>A fragment of candle, stuck tightly into the neck
of an empty bottle, appeared on a low shelf, and Keith
lighted it, the girl returning the lamp to its former
position on the front room table. Investigation revealed
a dozen cartridges fitting the revolver, but no ammunition
was discovered adapted to the sawed-off gun, which
Neb had already appropriated, and was dragging about
with him, peering into each black corner in anxious
search. The two were still busily employed at this,
when to their ears, through the stillness of the night,
there came the unexpected noise of splashing in the
water without, and then the sound of a horse stumbling
as he struck the bank. Quick as a flash Keith closed
the intervening door, extinguished the dim flame of
the candle, and grasping the startled negro&rsquo;s
arm, hushed him into silence.</p>

<p>Crouching close behind the door, through a crack of
which the light streamed, yielding slight view of
the interior, the plainsman anxiously awaited developments.
These arrivals must certainly be some of those connected
with the house; there could be little doubt as to that.
Nevertheless, they might prove the posse following
them, who had chanced to stumble accidentally on their
retreat. In either case they could merely wait, and
learn. Some one swore without, and was sharply rebuked
by another voice, which added an order gruffly. Then
the outer latch clicked, and a single man stepped
within, immediately closing the door. Keith could
not see the girl through the small aperture, but he
heard her quick exclamation, startled, yet full of
relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it you? I am so glad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man laughed lightly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is nice to be welcomed, although, perhaps,
after your time of loneliness any arrival would prove
a relief. Did you think I was never coming, Christie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not understand,&rdquo; she replied,
evidently with much less enthusiasm, and to Keith&rsquo;s
thinking, a shade resentful of the familiarity, &ldquo;but
naturally supposed you must be unexpectedly delayed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was,&rdquo; and he apparently flung
both coat and hat on a bench, with the intention of
remaining, &ldquo;The marshal arrested a fellow for
a murder committed out on the Santa F&eacute; Trail, and
required me as a witness. But the man got away before
we had any chance to try him, and I have been on his
trail ever since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A murder! Did you imagine he came this way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very likely; fact of it is, the sand storm
yesterday destroyed all traces, and, as a result,
we&rsquo;ve lost him. So I headed a few of the boys
over in this direction, as I wanted to relieve you
of anxiety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent an instant, and the man crossed to
the fireplace, where  Keith could gain a glimpse of
him. Already suspicious from the familiar sound of
his voice, he was not surprised to recognize &ldquo;Black
Bart.&rdquo; The plainsman&rsquo;s fingers gripped
the negro&rsquo;s arm, his eyes burning. So this gambler
and blackleg was the gentlemanly Mr. Hawley, was he;
well, what could be his little game? Why had he inveigled
the girl into this lonely spot? And what did he now
propose doing with her? As he crouched there, peering
through that convenient crack in the door, Keith completely
forgot his own peril, intent only upon this new discovery.
She came slowly around the end of the table, and stood
leaning against it, her face clearly revealed in the
light of the lamp. For the first time Keith really
perceived its beauty, its fresh charm. Could such as
she be singer and dancer in a frontier concert hall?
And if so, what strange conditions ever drove her
into that sort of life?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is--is Fred with you?&rdquo; she questioned,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s with another party riding farther
west,&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s eyes surveying her with
manifest approval. &ldquo;You are certainly looking
fine to-night, my girl. It&rsquo;s difficult to understand
how I ever managed to keep away from you so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She flushed to the hair, her lips trembling at the
open boldness of his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I--I prefer you would not speak like that,&rdquo;
she protested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; with a light laugh. &ldquo;Come,
Christie, such fine airs are a trifle out of place.
If I didn&rsquo;t know you were a concert hall artist,
I might be more deeply impressed. As it is, I reckon
you&rsquo;ve heard love words before now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawley, I have trusted you as a gentleman.
I never came here except on your promise to bring
me to my brother,&rdquo; and she stood erect before
him. &ldquo;You have no right to even assume that I
am Christie Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure not; I don&rsquo;t assume. I have seen
that lady too often to be mistaken. Don&rsquo;t try
on that sort of thing with me--I don&rsquo;t take to
it kindly. Perhaps a kiss might put you in better
humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a step forward, as though proposing to carry
out his threat, but the girl stopped him, her eyes
burning with indignation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you!&rdquo; she exclaimed passionately,
all fear leaving her in sudden resentment. &ldquo;You
think me alone here and helpless; that you can insult
me at your pleasure. Don&rsquo;t go too far, Mr. Hawley.
I know what you are now, and it makes no difference
what you may think of me, or call me; you &rsquo;ll
find me perfectly able to defend myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; sneeringly, &ldquo;you are
melodramatic; you should have been an actress instead
of a singer. But you waste your talent out here on
me. Do you imagine I fear either you, or your precious
brother? Why, I could have him hung to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was staring at him with wide open eyes, her face
white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What--what do you mean? What has Fred done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was cold and sarcastic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference; it is what I could
induce men to swear he had done. It&rsquo;s easy enough
to convict in this country, if you only know how. I
simply tell you this, so you won&rsquo;t press me too
hard. Puritanism is out of place west of the Missouri,
especially among ladies of your profession. Oh, come,
now, Christie, don&rsquo;t try to put such airs on
with me. I know who you are, all right, and can guess
why you are hunting after Fred Willoughby. I pumped
the boy, and got most of the truth out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You--you have seen him, then, since you left
me,&rdquo; she faltered, bewildered, &ldquo;and didn&rsquo;t
bring him here with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; and the man stepped forward,
his eyes on her, his hands twitching with a desire
to clasp her to him, yet restrained by some undefinable
power. &ldquo;While I believed your brother story,
I could have played the good Samaritan most beautifully,
but after I talked with Willoughby I prefer him at
a distance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother story! Do you mean to insinuate
you doubt his being my brother? He told you that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He gave up the whole trick. You can&rsquo;t
trust a kid like that, Christie. A couple of drinks
will loosen his tongue, and put you in wrong. Come,
now, I know it all; be reasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apparently the girl had lost her power of speech,
staring blindly at the face of the man before her,
as a bird meets the slow approach of a snake. Keith
could see her lips move, but making no sound. Hawley
evidently interpreted her silence as hesitation, doubt
as to his real meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see where you are at now, Christie,&rdquo;
he went on swiftly. &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t need
to be afraid. I&rsquo;m going to be a friend to you,
and you can be mighty glad you got rid of Willoughby
so easily. Why, I can buy you diamonds where he couldn&rsquo;t
give you a calico dress. Come on, let&rsquo;s stop
this foolishness. I took a liking to you back there
in the stage, and the more I&rsquo;ve thought about
you since the crazier I&rsquo;ve got. When I succeeded
in pumping Willoughby dry, and discovered you wasn&rsquo;t
his sister at all, why that settled the matter. I
came down here after you. I love you, do you understand
that? And, what&rsquo;s more, I intend to have you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached out, and actually grasped her, but, in
some manner, she tore loose, and sprang back around
the end of the table, her cheeks flushed, her eyes
burning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me! don&rsquo;t dare touch
me!&rdquo; she panted. &ldquo;You lie; Fred Willoughby
never told you that. If you come one step nearer, I&rsquo;ll
scream; I&rsquo;ll call your men here; I&rsquo;ll
tell them the kind of a cur you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, leaning over toward her, yet hesitating,
his eyes full of admiration. Her very fierceness appealed
to him, urged him on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t! In the first place they
probably wouldn&rsquo;t hear, for they are camped
down in the corral. I suspected you might be something
of a tigress, and preferred to fight it out with you
alone. Then, even if they did hear, there would be
no interference--I&rsquo;ve got those fellows trained
too well for that. Come on, Christie; you&rsquo;re
helpless here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took a step toward her, his hands flung out. With
one quick movement she sprang aside and extinguished
the lamp, plunging the room into instant darkness.
A few red coals glowed dully in the fireplace, but
all else was dense blackness. Keith heard the movements
of Hawley, as he felt his way uncertainly along the
table, swearing as he failed to find the girl. Then,
like a shadow, he glided through the partly open door
into the room.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XI"></a>Chapter XI</h1>

<h2>The Fight in the Dark</h2>

<p>Had the room been filled with men Keith could have
restrained himself no longer. Whatever her past might
be, this woman appealed to him strangely; he could
not believe evil of her; he would have died if need
be in her defence. But as it was, the ugly boast of
Hawley gave confidence in the final outcome of this
struggle in the dark, even a possibility of escape
for them all. The gambler, assured of being confronted
merely by a frail and not over-scrupulous woman, had
ventured there alone; had stationed his men beyond
sound; had doubtless instructed them to ignore any
noise of struggle which they might overhear within.
It was these very arrangements for evil which now
afforded opportunity, and Keith crept forward, alert
and ready, his teeth clenched, his hands bare for contest.
Even although he surprised his antagonist, it was
going to be a fight for life; he knew &ldquo;Black
Bart,&rdquo; broad-shouldered, quick as a cat, accustomed
to every form of physical exercise, desperate and
tricky, using either knife or gun recklessly. Yet
it was now or never for all of them, and the plainsman
felt no mercy, experienced no reluctance. He reached
the table, and straightened up, silent, expectant.
For an instant there was no further sound; no evidence
of movement in the room. Hawley, puzzled by the silence,
was listening intently in an endeavor to thus locate
the girl through some rustling, some slight motion.
A knife, knocked from the table, perhaps, as she slipped
softly past, fell clattering to the floor, and the
gambler leaped instantly forward. Keith&rsquo;s grip
closed like iron on his groping arm, while he shot
one fist out toward where the man&rsquo;s head should
be. The blow glanced, yet drove the fellow backward,
stumbling against the table, and Keith closed in,
grappling for the throat. The other, startled by the
unexpected attack, and scarcely realizing even yet
the nature of his antagonist, struggled blindly to
escape the fingers clawing at him, and flung one hand
down to the knife in his belt. Warned by the movement,
the assailant drove his head into the gambler&rsquo;s
chest, sending him crashing to the floor, falling
himself heavily upon the prostrate body. Hawley gave
utterance to one cry, half throttled in his throat,
and then the two grappled fiercely, so interlocked
together as to make weapons useless. Whoever the assailant
might be, the gambler was fully aware by now that
he was being crushed in the grasp of a fighting man,
and exerted every wrestler&rsquo;s trick, every ounce
of strength, to break free. Twice he struggled to
his knees, only to be crowded backward by relentless
power; once he hurled Keith sideways, but the plainsman&rsquo;s
muscles stiffened into steel, and he gradually regained
his position. Neither dared release a grip in order
to strike a blow: neither had sufficient breath left
with which to utter a sound. They were fighting for
life, silently, desperately, like wild beasts, with
no thought but to injure the other. The gambler&rsquo;s
teeth sank into Keith&rsquo;s arm, and the latter
in return jammed the man&rsquo;s head back onto the
puncheon floor viciously. Perspiration streamed from
their bodies, their fingers clutching, their limbs
wrapped together, their muscles strained to the utmost.
Keith had forgotten the girl, the negro, everything,
dominated by the one passion to conquer. He was swept
by a storm of hatred, a desire to kill. In their fierce
struggle the two had rolled close to the fireplace,
and in the dull glow of the dying embers, he could
perceive a faint outline of the man&rsquo;s face.
The sight added flame to his mad passion, yet he could
do nothing except to cling to him, jabbing his fingers
into the straining throat.</p>

<p>The negro ended the affair in his own way, clawing
blindly at the combatants in the darkness, and finally,
determining which was the enemy, he struck the gambler
with the stock of his gun, laying him out unconscious.
Keith, grasping the table, hauled himself to his feet,
gasping for breath, certain only that Hawley was no
longer struggling. For an instant all was blank, a
mist of black vapor; then a realization of their situation
came back in sudden flood of remembrance. Even yet
he could see nothing, but felt the motionless figure
at his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; he urged, the instant he could
make himself speak. &ldquo;The fellow is only stunned;
we must tie and gag him. Is that you, Neb? Where is
the girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here, Captain Keith,&rdquo; and he heard
the soft rustle of her dress across the room. &ldquo;What
is it I may do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A coil of rope, or some straps, with a piece
of cloth; anything you can lay hands on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was some moments at it, confused by the darkness,
and Hawley moved slightly, his labored breathing growing
plainly perceptible. Keith heard her groping toward
him, and held out his hands. She started as he thus
unexpectedly touched her, yet made no effort to break
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You--you frightened me a little,&rdquo; she
confessed. &ldquo;This has all happened so quickly
I hardly realize yet just what has occurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The action has only really begun,&rdquo; he
assured her, still retaining his hold upon her hand.
&ldquo;This was merely a preliminary skirmish, and
you must prepare to bear your part in what follows.
We have settled Mr. Hawley for the present, and now
must deal with his gang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what would I have done if you had not been
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us not think about that; we were here,
and now have a busy night before us if we get away
safely. Give me the rope first. Good! Here, Neb, you
must know how to use this,--not too tight, but without
leaving any play to the arms; take the knife out of
his belt. Now for the cloth, Miss Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please do not call me that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you said it didn&rsquo;t make any difference
what I called you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it didn&rsquo;t then, but it does
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see; we are already on a new footing.
Yet I must call you something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated just long enough for him to notice it.
Either she had no substitute ready at hand, or else
doubted the advisability of confiding her real name
under present circumstances to one so nearly a stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may call me Hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A name certainly of good omen,&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;From this moment I shall forget Christie Maclaire,
and remember only Miss Hope. All right, Neb; now turn
over a chair, and sit your man up against it. He will
rest all the easier in that position until his gang
arrive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He thrust his head out of the door, peering cautiously
forth into the night, and listening. A single horse,
probably the one Hawley had been riding, was tied
to a dwarfed cottonwood near the corner of the cabin.
Nothing else living was visible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to round up our horses, and learn
the condition of Hawley&rsquo;s outfit,&rdquo; he
announced in a low voice. &ldquo;I may be gone for
fifteen or twenty minutes, and, meanwhile, Miss Hope,
get ready for a long ride. Neb, stand here close beside
the door, and if any one tries to come in brain him
with your gun-stock. I&rsquo;ll rap three times when
I return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He slipped out into the silent night, and crept cautiously
around the end of the dark cabin. The distinct change
in the girl&rsquo;s attitude of friendship toward
him, her very evident desire that he should think well
of her, together with the providential opportunity
for escape, had left him full of confidence. The gambler
had played blindly into their hands, and Keith was
quick enough to accept the advantage. It was a risk
to himself, to be sure, thus turning again to the
northward, yet the clear duty he owed the girl left
such a choice almost imperative. He certainly could
not drag her along with him on his flight into the
wild Comanche country extending beyond the Canadian.
She must, at the very least, be first returned to
the protection of the semi-civilization along the
Arkansas. After that had been accomplished, he would
consider his own safety. He wondered if Hope really
was her name, and whether it was the family cognomen,
or her given name. That she was Christie Maclaire he
had no question, yet that artistic embellishment was
probably merely assumed for the work of the concert
hall. Both he and Hawley could scarcely be mistaken
as to her identity in this respect, and, indeed, she
had never openly denied the fact. Yet she did not
at all seem to be that kind, and Keith mentally contrasted
her with numerous others whom he had somewhat intimately
known along the border circuit. It was difficult to
associate her with that class; she must have come
originally from some excellent family East, and been
driven to the life by necessity; she was more to be
pitied than blamed. Keith held no puritanical views
of life--his own experiences had been too rough and
democratic for that--yet he clung tenaciously to an
ideal of womanhood which could not be lowered. However
interested he might otherwise feel, no Christie Maclaire
could ever find entrance into the deeps of his heart,
where dwelt alone the memory of his mother.</p>

<p>He found the other horses turned into the corral,
and was able, from their restless movements, to decide
they numbered eight. A fire, nearly extinguished,
glowed dully at the farther corner of the enclosure,
and he crawled close enough to distinguish the recumbent
forms of men sleeping about it on the ground. Apparently
no guard had been set, the fellows being worn out
from their long ride, and confident of safety in this
isolated spot. Besides, Hawley had probably assumed
that duty, and told them to get whatever sleep they
could. However, the gate of the corral opened beside
their fire, and Keith dare not venture upon roping
any of their ponies, or leading them out past where
they slept. There might be clippers in the cabin with
which he could cut the wires, yet if one of the gang
awoke, and discovered the herd absent, it would result
in an alarm, and lead to early pursuit. It was far
safer to use their own ponies. He would lead Hawley&rsquo;s
horse quietly through the water, and they could mount
on the other shore. This plan settled, he went at it
swiftly, riding the captured animal while rounding
up the others, and fastening the three to stunted
trees on the opposite bank. Everything within the cabin
remained exactly as he had left it, and he briefly
explained the situation, examining Hawley&rsquo;s
bonds again carefully while doing so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll remain there all right until his
men find him,&rdquo; he declared, positively, &ldquo;and
that ought to give us a good six hours&rsquo; start.
Come, Miss Hope, every minute counts now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held her arm, not unconscious of its round shapeliness,
as he helped her down the rather steep bank through
the dense gloom. Then the two men joined hands, and
carrying her easily between them, waded the shallow
stream. The horses, not yet sufficiently rested to
be frisky, accepted their burdens meekly enough, and,
with scarcely a word spoken, the three rode away silently
into the gloom of the night.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XII"></a>Chapter XII</h1>

<h2>Through the Night Shadows</h2>

<p>Keith had very little to guide him, as he could not
determine whether this mysterious cabin on the Salt
Fork lay to east or west of the usual cattle trail
leading down to the Canadian. Yet he felt reasonably
assured that the general trend of the country lying
between the smaller stream and the valley of the Arkansas
would be similar to that with which he was already
acquainted. It was merely a wild stretch of sandy desolation,
across which their horses would leave scarcely any
trail, and even that little would be quickly obliterated
by the first puff of wind. As they drew in toward the
river valley this plain would change into sand dunes,
baffling and confusing, but no matter how hard they
pressed forward, it must be daylight long before they
could hope to reach these, and this would give him
opportunity to spy out some familiar landmark which
would guide them to the ford. Meanwhile, he must head
as directly north as possible, trusting the horses
to find footing.</p>

<p>It was plains instinct, or rather long training in
the open, which enabled him to retain any true sense
of direction, for beyond the narrow fringe of cotton-woods
along the stream, nothing was visible, the eyes scarcely
able even to distinguish where earth and sky met. They
advanced across a bare level, without elevation or
depression, yet the sand appeared sufficiently solid,
so that their horses were forced into a swinging lope,
and they seemed to fairly press aside the black curtain,
which as instantly swung shut once more, and closed
them in. The pounding hoofs made little noise, and
they pressed steadily onward, closely bunched together,
so as not to lose each other, dim, spectral shadows
flitting through the night, a very part of that grim
desolation surrounding them. No one of the three felt
like speaking; the gloomy, brooding desert oppressed
them, their vagrant thoughts assuming the tinge of
their surroundings; their hope centred on escape.
Keith rode, grasping the rein of the woman&rsquo;s
horse in his left hand, and bending low in vain effort
at picking a path. He had nothing to aim toward, yet
sturdy confidence in his expert plainscraft yielded
him sufficient sense of direction. He had noted the
bark of the cottonwoods, the direction of the wind,
and steered a course accordingly straight northward,
alert to avert any variation.</p>

<p>The girl rode easily, although in a man&rsquo;s saddle,
the stirrups much too long. Keith glanced aside with
swift approval at the erectness with which she sat,
the loosened rein in her hand, the slight swaying of
her form. He could appreciate horsemanship, and the
easy manner in which she rode relieved him of one
anxiety. It even caused him to break the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are evidently accustomed to riding, Miss
Hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She glanced across at him through the darkness, as
though suddenly surprised from thought, her words
not coming quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot remember when I first mounted a horse;
in earliest childhood, surely, although I have not
ridden much of late. This one is like a rocking chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He belonged to your friend, Mr. Hawley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew a quick breath, her face again turned forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who--who is that man? Do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I possess a passing acquaintance,&rdquo; he
answered, uncertain yet how much to tell her, but
tempted to reveal all in test of her real character.
&ldquo;Few do not who live along the Kansas border.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean he is a notoriously bad character?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never heard of his being held up as
a model to the young, Miss Hope,&rdquo; he returned
more soberly, convinced that she truly possessed no
real knowledge regarding the man, and was not merely
pretending innocence. &ldquo;I had never heard him
called Hawley before, and, therefore, failed to recognize
him under that respectable name. But I knew his voice
the moment he entered the cabin, and realized that
some devilment was afoot. Every town along this frontier
has his record, and I&rsquo;ve met him maybe a dozen
times in the past three years. He is known as &lsquo;Black
Bart&rsquo;; is a gambler by profession, a desperado
by reputation, and a cur by nature. Just now I suspect
him of being even deeper in the mire than this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could tell by the quick clasping of her hands on
the pommel of the saddle the effect of his words,
but waited until the silence compelled her to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know! You do not believe
that I ever suspected such a thing? That I ever met
him there understanding who he was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;What
I overheard between you convinced me you were the
victim of deceit. But your going to that place alone
was a most reckless act.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted her hand to her eyes, her head drooping
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it what he told me--the out-station
of a ranch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I have ridden this country for years, and
there is no ranch pasturing cattle along the Salt
Fork. Miss Hope, I want you to comprehend what it is
you have escaped from; what you are now fleeing from.
Within the last two years an apparently organized
body of outlaws have been operating throughout this
entire region. Oftentimes disguised as Indians, they
have terrorized the Santa F&eacute; trail for two hundred
miles, killing travellers in small parties, and driving
off stock. There are few ranches as far west as this,
but these have all suffered from raids. These fellows
have done more to precipitate the present Indian war
than any act of the savages. They have endeavored
to make the authorities believe that Indians were guilty
of their deeds of murder and robbery. Both troops and
volunteers have tried to hold the gang up, but they
scatter and disappear, as though swallowed by the
desert. I have been out twice, hard on their trail,
only to come back baffled. Now, I think accident has
given me the clue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She straightened up; glancing questioningly at him
through the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what I mean, Miss Hope. I suspect that
cabin to be the rendezvous of those fellows, and I
half believe Hawley to be their leader.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you will report all this to the authorities?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled grimly, his lips compressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly think so; at least, not for the present.
I am not blood-thirsty, or enamored of man-hunting,
but I happen to have a personal interest in this particular
affair which I should prefer to settle alone.&rdquo;
He paused, swiftly reviewing the circumstances of
their short acquaintance, and as suddenly determining
to trust her discretion. Deep down in his heart he
rather wanted her to know. &ldquo;The fact of the matter
is, that Neb and I here were the ones that particular
posse were trailing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; her voice faltered. &ldquo;He said
those men were under arrest for murder, and had broken
jail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He also said it was easy to convict men in
this country if you only knew how. It is true we broke
jail, but only in order to save our lives; it was
the only way. Technically, we are outlaws, and now
run the risk of immediate re-arrest by returning north
of the Arkansas. We came to you fugitives; I was charged
with murder, the negro with assault. So, you see,
Miss Hope, the desperate class of men you are now associating
with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slight bitterness in his tone stung the girl into
resentment. She was looking straight at him, but in
the gloom he could not discern the expression of her
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; she exclaimed
decisively, &ldquo;you--you do not look like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My appearance may be sufficient to convince
you,&rdquo; he returned, rather dryly, &ldquo;but
would weigh little before a Western court. Unfortunately,
the evidence was strong against me; or would have
been had the case ever come to a trial. The strange
thing about it was that both warrants were sworn out
by the same complainant, and apparently for a similar
purpose--&rsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; Hawley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To keep us from telling what we knew regarding
a certain crime, in which either he, or some of his
intimate friends, were deeply interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it would all come out at the trial, wouldn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was to be no trial; Judge Lynch settles
the majority of such cases out here at present. It
is extremely simple. Listen, and I will tell you the
story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reviewed briefly those occurrences leading directly
up to his arrest, saying little regarding the horrors
of that scene witnessed near the Cimmaron Crossing,
but making sufficiently clear his very slight connection
with it, and the reason those who were guilty of the
crime were so anxious to get him out of the way. She
listened intently, asking few questions, until he
ended. Then they both looked up, conscious that dawn
was becoming gray in the east. Keith&rsquo;s first
thought was one of relief-- the brightening sky showed
him they were riding straight north.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XIII"></a>Chapter XIII</h1>

<h2>The Ford of the Arkansas</h2>

<p>They were still in the midst of the yellow featureless
plain, but the weary horses had slowed down to a walk,
the heavy sand retarding progress. It was a gloomy,
depressing scene in the spectral gray light, a wide
circle of intense loneliness, unbroken by either dwarfed
shrub or bunch of grass, a barren expanse stretching
to the sky. Vague cloud shadows seemed to flit across
the level surface, assuming fantastic shapes, but all
of the same dull coloring, imperfect and unfinished.
Nothing seemed tangible or real, but rather some grotesque
picture of delirium, ever merging into another yet
more hideous. The very silence of those surrounding
wastes seemed burdensome, adding immeasurably to the
horror. They were but specks crawling underneath the
sky--the only living, moving objects in all that immense
circle of desolation and death.</p>

<p>Keith turned in the saddle, looking back past Neb--who
swayed in his seat, with head lolling on his breast
as though asleep, his horse plodding after the others--along
the slight trail they had made across the desert. So
far as eye could reach nothing moved, nothing apparently
existed. Fronting again to the north he looked upon
the same grim barrenness, only that far off, against
the lighter background of distant sky, there was visible
a faint blur, a bluish haze, which he believed to
be the distant sand dunes bordering the Arkansas.
The intense dreariness of it all left a feeling of
depression. His eyes turned and regarded the girl riding
silently beside him. The same look of depression was
visible upon her face, and she was gazing off into
the dull distance with lack-lustre eyes, her slender
form leaning forward, her hands clasped across the
pommel. The long weariness of the night had left traces
on her young face, robbing it of some of its freshness,
yet Keith found it more attractive in the growing daylight
than amid the lamp shadows of the evening before.
He had not previously realized the peculiar clearness
of her complexion, the rose tint showing through the
olive skin, or the soft and silky fineness of her hair,
which, disarranged, was strangely becoming under the
broad brim of the hat she wore, drawn low until it
shadowed her eyes. It was not a face to be easily
associated with frontier concert halls, or any surrender
to evil; the chin round and firm, the lips full, yet
sufficiently compressed; the whole expression that
of pure and dignified womanhood. She puzzled him, and
he scarcely knew what to believe, or exactly how to
act toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our friends back yonder should be turning out
from the corral by now,&rdquo; he said finally, anxious
to break the silence, for she had not spoken since
he ended his tale. &ldquo;It will not be long until
they discover Hawley&rsquo;s predicament, and perhaps
the welkin already rings with profanity. That may
even account for the blue haze out yonder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned her eyes toward him, and the slightest
trace of a smile appeared from out the depths of their
weariness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they would only remain satisfied with that.
Will they follow us, do you think? And are we far
enough away by this time to be safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hardly likely they will let us escape
without a chase,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;We
possess too much information now that we have their
rendezvous located, and &lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; will
have a private grudge to revenge. I wonder if he suspects
who attacked him! But don&rsquo;t worry, Miss Hope;
we have miles the start, and the wind has been strong
enough to cover our trail. Do you see that dark irregularity
ahead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; is it a cloud?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the Arkansas sand dunes. I am going to
try to keep the horses moving until we arrive there.
Then we will halt and eat whatever Neb has packed
behind him, and rest for an hour or two. You look very
tired, but I hope you can keep up for that distance.
We shall be safely out of sight then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I am tired; the strain of waiting alone
in that cabin, and all that happened last night, have
tried me severely. But--but I can go through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice proved her weakness, although it was determined
enough, and Keith, yielding to sudden impulse, put
out his hand, and permitted it to rest upon hers,
clasped across the pommel. Her eyes drooped, but there
was no change of posture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your nerve is all right,&rdquo; he said, admiringly,
&ldquo;you have shown yourself a brave girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could not be a coward, and be my father&rsquo;s
daughter,&rdquo; she replied, with an odd accent of
pride in her choking voice, &ldquo;but I have been
afraid, and --and I am still.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of what? Surely, not that those fellows will
ever catch up with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I hardly know what, only there is a dread
I cannot seem to shake off, as if some evil impended,
the coming of which I can feel, but not see. Have
you ever experienced any such premonition?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, withdrawing his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. I am far too prosaic a mortal
to allow dreams to worry me. So far I have discovered
sufficient trouble in real life to keep my brain active.
Even now I cannot forget how hungry I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not answer, comprehending how useless it would
be to explain, and a little ashamed of her own ill-defined
fears, and thus they rode on in silence. He did not
notice that she glanced aside at him shyly, marking
the outline of his clear-cut features, silhouetted
against the far-off sky. It was a manly face, strong,
alive, full of character, the well-shaped head firmly
poised, the broad shoulders squared in spite of the
long night of weary exertion. The depths of her eyes
brightened with appreciation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe your story, Mr. Keith,&rdquo; she
said at last softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My story?&rdquo; questioningly, and turning
instantly toward her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; all that you have told me about what happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh; I had almost forgotten having told it,
but I never felt any doubt but what you would believe.
I don&rsquo;t think I could lie to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was no compliment, but spoken with such evident
honesty that her eyes met his with frankness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There could be no necessity; only I wanted
you to know that I trust you, and am grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She extended her hand this time, and he took it within
his own, holding it firmly, yet without knowing what
to answer. There was strong impulse within him to
question her, to learn then and there her own life
story. Yet, somehow, the reticence of the girl restrained
him; he could not deliberately probe beneath the veil
she kept lowered between them. Until she chose to
lift it herself voluntarily, he possessed no right
to intrude. The gentlemanly instincts of younger years
held him silent, realizing clearly that whatever secret
might dominate her life, it was hers to conceal just
so long as she pleased. Out of this swift struggle
of repression he managed to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your confidence, and mean to prove
worthy. Perhaps some day I can bring you the proofs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need none other than your own word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but possibly you are too easily convinced;
you believed in Hawley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him searchingly, her eyes glowing, her
cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly, convincingly.
&ldquo;I know I did; I--I was so anxious to be helped,
but--but this is different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was noon, the sun pitiless and hot above them,
before they straggled within the partial shelter of
the sand dunes, and sank wearily down to their meagre
lunch. Their supply of water was limited, and the exhausted
ponies must wait until they reached the river to quench
their thirst. Yet this was not very far off now, and
Keith had seen enough of their surroundings to locate
the position of the ford. Slow as they must proceed,
three hours more would surely bring them to the bank
of the stream. They discussed their plans briefly
as the three sat together on the warm sand, revived
both by the food and the brief rest. There was not
a great deal to be determined, only where the girl
should be left, and how the two men had better proceed
to escape observation.</p>

<p>Fort Larned was the nearest and safest place for their
charge, none of the party expressing any desire to
adventure themselves within the immediate neighborhood
of Carson City. What her future plans might be were
not revealed, and Keith forebore any direct questioning.
His duty plainly ended with placing her in a safe
environment, and he felt convinced that Mrs. Murphy,
of the Occidental Hotel, would furnish room, and, if
necessary, companionship. The sole problem remaining--after
she had rather listlessly agreed to such an arrangement--was
to so plan the details as to permit the negro and
himself to slip through the small town clustered about
the post without attracting undue attention. No doubt,
the story of their escape had already reached there,
embellished by telling, and serious trouble might
result from discovery. Keith was surprised at the
slight interest she exhibited in these arrangements,
merely signifying her acquiescence by a word, but
he charged it to physical weariness, and the reaction
from her night of peril; yet he took pains to explain
fully his plan, and to gain her consent.</p>

<p>This finally settled, they mounted again and rode
on through the lanes traversing the sand dunes, keeping
headed as straight as possible toward the river. The
ford sought was some miles down stream, but with the
horses&rsquo; thirst mitigated, they made excellent
progress, and arrived at the spot early in the evening.
Not in all the day had they encountered a living object,
or seen a moving thing amid the surrounding desolation.
Now, looking across to the north, a few gleaming lights
told of Fort Larned perched upon the opposite bluffs.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XIV"></a>Chapter XIV</h1>

<h2>The Landlady of the Occidentals</h2>

<p>Keith had crossed at this point so frequently with
cattle that, once having his bearings, the blackness
of the night made very little difference. Nevertheless,
in fear lest her pony might stumble over some irregularity,
he gave his own rein to Neb, and went forward on foot,
grasping firmly the tired animal&rsquo;s bit. It was
a long stretch of sand and water extending from bank
to bank, but the latter was shallow, the only danger
being that of straying off from the more solid bottom
into quicksand. With a towering cottonwood as guide,
oddly misshapen and standing out gauntly against the
slightly lighter sky, the plainsman led on unhesitatingly,
until they began to climb the rather sharp uplift of
the north bank. Here there was a plain trail, pounded
into smoothness by the hoofs of cavalry horses ridden
down to water, and at the summit they emerged within
fifty yards of the stables.</p>

<p>The few lights visible, some stationary, with others
dancing about like will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps, revealed
imperfectly the contour of various buildings, but
Keith turned sharply to the right, anxious to slip
past without being challenged by a sentry. Beyond
the brow of the bluff other lights now became visible,
flickering here and there, marking where a straggling
town had sprung up under the protection of the post--a
town garish enough in the daylight, composed mostly
of shacks and tents, but now with its deficiencies
mercifully concealed by the enveloping darkness. The
trail, easily followed, led directly along its single
street, but Keith circled the outskirts through a
wilderness of tin-cans and heaps of other debris,
until he halted his charges beside the black shadow
of the only two-story edifice in the place. This was
the Occidental, the hospitality of which he had frequently
tested.</p>

<p>A light streamed from out the front windows, but,
uncertain who might be harbored within, Keith tapped
gently at the back door. It was not opened immediately,
and when it was finally shoved aside the merest crack,
no glow of light revealed the darkened interior. The
voice which spoke, however, was amply sufficient to
identify its owner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that ye agin, Murphy, a playin&rsquo; av
yer dirthy thricks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Murphy,&rdquo; he hastened to explain,
&ldquo;this is Keith--Jack Keith, of the &lsquo;Bar
X.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord deliver us!&rdquo; was the instant
exclamation, the door opening wide. &ldquo;They do
be afther tellin&rsquo; me to-night av the throuble
ye was in over at Carson, an&rsquo; Oi t&rsquo;ought
maybe ye moight turn up this way. It was a nate thrick
ye played on the loikes av &rsquo;em, Jack, but this
is a dom poor place fer ye ter hide in. Bedad, there&rsquo;s
a half-dozen in the parly now talkin&rsquo;  about
it, wid a couple av officers from the fort. Is the
nager wid ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we have no intention of hiding here.
I&rsquo;d rather take my chance in the open. The fact
is, Kate, we started off for the &lsquo;Bar X.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Av course, ye did; Oi was shure av it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But down on the Salt Fork we ran across a young
girl whom Black Bart had inveigled down that way on
a lie. We had a bit of a fight, and got her away from
him. This is what brought us back here--to put the
girl where she will be safe out of his clutches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door was wide open now, and Mrs. Murphy outside,
her interest at fever heat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye had a foight wid Black Bart! Oh, ye divil!
An&rsquo; ye licked the dirthy spalpane, an&rsquo;
got away wid his gyurl! Glory be! And would Oi take
her? Well, Oi would. Niver doubt that, me bye. She
may be the quane av Shaba, an&rsquo; she may be a
Digger Injun Squaw, but the loikes av him had betther
kape away from Kate Murphy. It&rsquo;s glad Oi am ter
do it! Bring her in. Oi don&rsquo;t want ter hear
no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a word, Kate; I don&rsquo;t know whether
she has any money or not, but I &rsquo;ll pay her
bill, as soon as it is safe for me to come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the divil take her bill. She&rsquo;ll have
the best in the house, annyhow, an&rsquo; Oi&rsquo;m
only hopin&rsquo; that fellow will turn up huntin&rsquo;
her. Oi&rsquo;d loike ter take one slap at the spalpane.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fully convinced as to Mrs. Murphy&rsquo;s good-will,
Keith slipped back into the darkness, and returned
with the girl. Introductions were superfluous, as
the mistress of the Occidental cared little regarding
ceremony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; is this you, my dear?&rdquo; she
burst out, endeavoring to curb her voice to secretive
softness. &ldquo;Shure, Jack Keith has told me all
about it, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s safe it is yer goin&rsquo;
ter be here. Come on in; Oi&rsquo;ll give ye number
forty-two, thet&rsquo;s next behint me own room, an&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll go up the back sthairs. Hilp the young
loidy, Jack, fer shure ye know the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She disappeared, evidently with some hospitable purpose
in view, and Keith, clasping the girl&rsquo;s hand,
undertook the delicate task of safely escorting her
through the dark kitchen, and up the dimly remembered
stairs. Only a word or two passed between them, but
as they neared the second story a light suddenly streamed
out through the opened door of a room at their left.
Mrs. Murphy greeted them at the landing, and for the
first time saw the girl&rsquo;s weary white face, her
eyes filled with appeal, and the warm Irish heart
responded instantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye poor little lamb; it&rsquo;s the bid ye
want, an&rsquo; a dhrap o&rsquo; whiskey. Jack Keith,
why didn&rsquo;t ye till me she was done up wid the
hard ride? Here, honey, sit down in the rocker till
Oi get ye a wee dhrink. It&rsquo;ll bring the roses
back to the cheeks av ye.&rdquo; She was gone, bustling
down the dark stairs, and the two were alone in the
room, the girl looking up into his face, her head
resting against the cushioned back of the chair. He
thought he saw a glimmer of tears in the depths of
her lash-shaded eyes, and her round white throat seemed
to choke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be perfectly secure here,&rdquo; he
said, soothingly, &ldquo;and can remain as long as
you please. Mrs. Murphy will guard you as though you
were her own daughter. She is a bit rough, maybe,
but a big-hearted woman, and despises Hawley. She
nursed me once through a touch of typhoid--yes, by
Jove,&rdquo; glancing about in sudden recognition,
&ldquo;and in this very room, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s glance wandered over the plain, neat
furnishings, and the rather pathetic attempts at decoration,
yet with apparently no thought for them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You--you have not told me where you were going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, a little uneasily, as though he preferred
to make light of the whole matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I have hardly decided, the world is
so wide, and I had no reason to suppose you interested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am interested,&rdquo; resenting his tone
of assumed indifference. &ldquo;I would not want to
feel that our acquaintance was to wholly end now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I not? You have been a real friend
to me; I shall remember you always with a gratitude
beyond words. I want you to know this, and that--that I shall ever wish to retain that friendship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith struggled with himself, doubtful of what he
had best say, swayed by unfamiliar emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I shall never forget,&rdquo;
he blurted forth, desperately, &ldquo;and, if you
really wish it, I&rsquo;ll certainly see you again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; earnestly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;ll surely find a way. I don&rsquo;t
know now which direction we will ride, but I&rsquo;m
not going very far until I clear up that murder out
yonder on the trail; that is my particular job just
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before she could answer, Mrs. Murphy re&euml;ntered, and
forced her to drink the concoction prepared, the girl
accepting with smiling protest. The landlady, empty
glass in hand, swept her eyes about the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bedad, but the place looks betther than iver
Oi&rsquo;d belaved, wid the gyurl Oi&rsquo;ve got
tindin&rsquo; to it. She&rsquo;s that lazy she goes
ter slape swapin&rsquo; the flure. Jack, would ye
moind hilpin&rsquo; me move the bid; shure, it&rsquo;s
rale mahogany, an&rsquo; so heavy it breaks me back
intoirely to push it &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took hold willingly enough, and the two together
ran the heavy contrivance across the room to the position
selected. Once a leg caught in the rag carpet, and
Keith lifted it out, bending low to get a firmer grip.
Then he held out his hand to the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not going to be good-bye then, Miss Hope;
I&rsquo;ll find you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She smiled up into his eyes, much of the weariness
gone from her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to believe that,&rdquo; she answered,
gladly, &ldquo;because I want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy lingered until his steps sounded on the
stairs, as he slowly felt his way down through the
darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He do be a moighty foine bye, Jack Keith,&rdquo;
she said, apparently addressing the side wall. &ldquo;Oi
wish Oi&rsquo;d a knowed him whin Oi was a gyurl;
shure, it&rsquo;s not Murphy me noime&rsquo;d be now,
Oi&rsquo;m t&rsquo;inkin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Left alone, the girl bowed her head on her hands,
a hot tear stealing down through her fingers. As she
glanced up again, something that glittered on the
floor beside the bed caught her eyes. She stopped and
picked it up, holding the trinket to the light, staring
at it as though fascinated. It was the locket Keith
had taken from the neck of the dead man at Cimmaron
Crossing. Her nerveless fingers pressed the spring,
and the painted face within looked up into her own,
and still clasping it within her hand, she sank upon
her knees, burying her face on the bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did he get that?&rdquo; her lips kept
repeating. &ldquo;Where did he ever get that?&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XV"></a>Chapter XV</h1>

<h2>Again Christie Maclaire</h2>

<p>Keith possessed sufficient means for several months
of idleness, and even if he had not, his reputation
as a plains scout would insure him employment at any
of the more important scattered army posts. Reliable
men for such service were in demand. The restlessness
of the various Indian tribes, made specially manifest
by raids on the more advanced settlements, and extending
over a constantly widening territory, required continuous
interchange of communication between commanders of
detachments. Bold and reckless spirits had flocked
to the frontier in those days following the Civil
War, yet all were not of the type to encourage confidence
in military authorities. Keith had already frequently
served in this capacity, and abundantly proved his
worth under rigorous demands of both endurance and
intelligence, and he could feel assured of permanent
employment whenever desired. Not a few of the more
prominent officers he had met personally during the
late war--including Sheridan, to whom he had once
borne a flag of truce,--yet the spirit of the Confederacy
still lingered in his heart: not in any feeling of
either hatred or revenge, but in an unwillingness
to serve the blue uniform, and a memory of antagonism
which would not entirely disappear. He had surrendered
at Appomattox, conquered, yet he could not quite adjust
himself to becoming companion-in-arms with those
against whom he had fought valiantly for four years.
Some of the wounds of that conflict still smarted.
A natural soldier, anxious to help the harassed settlers,
eager enough to be actively employed, he still held
aloof from army connections except as a volunteer in
case of emergency.</p>

<p>Just now other considerations caused him to desire
freedom. He had been accused of murder, imprisoned
for it, and in order to escape, had been compelled
to steal horses, the most heinous crime of the frontier.
Not only for his own protection and safety must the
truth of that occurrence at the Cimmaron Crossing
be made clear, but he also had now a personal affair
with &ldquo;Black Bart&rdquo; Hawley to be permanently
settled. They had already clashed twice, and Keith
intended they should meet again.</p>

<p>Memory of the girl was still in his mind as he and
Neb rode silently forth on the black prairie, leading
the extra horse behind them. He endeavored to drive
the recollection from his mind, so he might concentrate
it upon plans for the future, but somehow she mysteriously
wove her own personality into those plans, and he
was ever seeing the pleading in her eyes, and listening
to the soft Southern accent of her voice. Of late
years he had been unaccustomed to association with
women of high type, and there was that touch of the
gentlewoman about this girl which had awakened deep
interest. Of course he knew that in her case it was
merely an inheritance of her past, and could not truly
represent the present Christie Maclaire of the music
halls. However fascinating she might be, she could
not be worthy any serious consideration. In spite of
his rough life the social spirit of the old South
was implanted in his blood, and no woman of that class
could hold him captive. Yet, some way, she refused
to be banished or left behind. Even Neb must have
been obsessed by a similar spirit, for he suddenly
observed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dat am sutt&rsquo;nly a mighty fine gal, Massa
Jack. I ain&rsquo;t seen nothin&rsquo; to compare
wid her since I quit ol&rsquo; Virginia--&rsquo;deed
I ain&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith glanced back at his black satellite, barely
able to distinguish the fellow&rsquo;s dim outlines.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think her a lady, then?&rdquo; he questioned,
giving thoughtless utterance to his own imagination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Deed I does!&rdquo; the thick voice
somewhat indignant. &ldquo;I reck&rsquo;n I knows de
real quality when I sees it. I&rsquo;se &rsquo;sociated
wid quality white folks befo&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Neb, she&rsquo;s a singer in dance halls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, Massa Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I wouldn&rsquo;t if I could help it.
She don&rsquo;t seem like that kind, but I recognized
her as soon as I got her face in the light. She was
at the Gaiety in Independence, the last time I was
there. Hawley knew her too, and called her by name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Neb rubbed his eyes, and slapped his pony&rsquo;s
flank, unable to answer, yet still unconvinced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reck&rsquo;n both ob yer might be mistook,&rdquo;
he insisted doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; and Keith&rsquo;s brief
laugh was not altogether devoid of bitterness. &ldquo;We
both called her Christie Maclaire, and she didn&rsquo;t
even deny the name; she was evidently not proud of
it, but there was no denial that she was the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dat wasn&rsquo;t like no name dat you called
her when we was ridin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; she didn&rsquo;t approve of the other,
and told me to call her Hope, but I reckon she&rsquo;s
Christie Maclaire all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rode on through the black, silent night as rapidly
as their tired horses would consent to travel. Keith
led directly across the open prairie, guiding his
course by the stars, and purposely avoiding the trails,
where some suspicious eye might mark their passage.
His first object was to get safely away from the scattered
settlements lying east of Carson City. Beyond their
radius he could safely dispose of the horses they
rode, disappear from view, and find time to develop
future plans. As to the girl--well, he would keep
his word with her, of course, and see her again sometime.
There would be no difficulty about that, but otherwise
she should retain no influence over him. She belonged
rather to Hawley&rsquo;s class than his.</p>

<p>It was a lonely, tiresome ride, during which Neb made
various efforts to talk, but finding his white companion
uncommunicative, at last relapsed into rather sullen
silence. The horses plodded on steadily, and when
daylight finally dawned, the two men found themselves
in a depression leading down to the Smoky River. Here
they came to a water hole, where they could safely
hide themselves and their stock. With both Indians
and white men to be guarded against, they took all
the necessary precautions, picketing the horses closely
under the rock shadows, and not venturing upon building
any fire. Neb threw himself on the turf and was instantly
asleep, but Keith climbed the steep side of the gully,
and made searching survey of the horizon. The wide
arc to south, east, and west revealed nothing to his
searching eyes, except the dull brown of the slightly
rolling plains, with no life apparent save some distant
grazing antelope, but to the north extended more broken
country with a faint glimmer of water between the
hills. Satisfied they were unobserved, he slid back
again into the depression. As he turned to lie down
he took hold of the saddle belonging to Hawley&rsquo;s
horse. In the unbuckled holster his eye observed the
glimmer of a bit of white paper. He drew it forth,
and gazed at it unthinkingly. It was an envelope,
robbed of its contents, evidently not sent through
the mails as it had not been stamped, but across its
face was plainly written, &ldquo;Miss Christie Maclaire.&rdquo;
He stared at it, his lips firm set, his gray eyes
darkening. If he possessed any doubts before as to
her identity, they were all thoroughly dissipated now.</p>

<p align="center">*       *       *       *
    *</p>

<p>As he lay there, with head pillowed on the saddle,
his body aching from fatigue yet totally unable to
sleep, staring open-eyed into the blue of the sky,
the girl they had left behind awoke from uneasy slumber,
aroused by the entrance of Mrs. Murphy. For an instant
she failed to comprehend her position, but the strong
brogue of the energetic landlady broke in sharply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bit av a cup av coffee fer ye, honey,&rdquo;
she explained, crossing to the bed. &ldquo;Shure an&rsquo;
there&rsquo;s nuthin&rsquo; loike it when ye first
wake up. Howly Mither, but it&rsquo;s toird &lsquo;nough
ye do be lookin&rsquo; yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t slept very well,&rdquo; the
girl confessed, bringing her hand out from beneath
the coverlet, the locket still tightly clasped in her
fingers. &ldquo;See, I found this on the floor last
night after you had gone down stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye did!&rdquo; setting the coffee on a convenient
chair, and reaching out for the trinket. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have a look at it once. Angels av Hiven, if it isn&rsquo;t
the same the ol&rsquo; Gineral was showin&rsquo; me
in the parly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other sat up suddenly, her white shoulders and
rounded throat gleaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old General, you said? What General? When
was he here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shure now, be aisy, honey, an&rsquo; Oi &rsquo;ll
tell ye all there is to it. It&rsquo;s not his name
Oi know; maybe Oi niver heard till av it, but &rsquo;twas
the &lsquo;Gineral&rsquo; they called him, all right.
He was here maybe three days outfittin&rsquo;--a noice
spoken ol&rsquo; gintlemin, wid a gray beard, an&rsquo;
onc&rsquo;t he showed me the locket--be the powers,
if it do be his, there&rsquo;s an openin&rsquo; to
it, an&rsquo; a picter inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl touched the spring, revealing the face within,
but her eyes were blinded with tears. The landlady
looked at her in alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, honey? What is it? Did you know
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slender form swayed forward, shaken with sobs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was my father, and--and this is my mother&rsquo;s
picture which he always carried.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope Waite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kate Murphy looked, at the face half hidden in the
bed-clothes. That was not the name which Keith had
given her, but she had lived on the border too long
to be inquisitive. The other lifted her head, flinging
back her loosened hair with one hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keith dropped it,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Where do you suppose he got it?&rdquo; Then
she gave a quick, startled cry, her eyes opening wide
in horror. &ldquo;The Cimmaron Crossing, the murder
at the Cimmaron Crossing! He--he told me about that;
but he never showed me this--this. Do you--do you think--&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice failed, but Kate Murphy gathered her into
her arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cry here, honey,&rdquo; she said, as if to
a child. &ldquo;Shure an&rsquo; Oi don&rsquo;t know
who it was got kilt out yonder, but Oi&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo;
ye it niver was Jack Keith what did it--murther ain&rsquo;t
his stoyle.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Introducing Doctor Fairbain</h2>

<p>Headed as they were, and having no other special objective
point in view, it was only natural for the two fugitives
to drift into Sheridan. This was at that time the
human cesspool of the plains country, a seething, boiling
maelstrom of all that was rough, evil, and brazen along
the entire frontier. Customarily quiet enough during
the hours of daylight, the town  became a mad saturnalia
with the approach of darkness, its ceaseless orgies
being noisily continued until dawn. But at this period
all track work on the Kansas Pacific being temporarily
suspended by Indian outbreaks, the graders made both
night and day alike hideous, and the single dirty
street which composed Sheridan, lined with shacks,
crowded with saloons, the dull dead prairie stretching
away on every side to the horizon, was congested with
humanity during every hour of the twenty-four.</p>

<p>It was a grim picture of depravity and desolation,
the environment dull, gloomy, forlorn; all that was
worthy the eye or thought being the pulsing human
element. All about extended the barren plains, except
where on one side a ravine cut through an overhanging
ridge. From the seething street one could look up
to the summit, and see there the graves of the many
who had died deaths of violence, and been borne thither
in &ldquo;their boots.&rdquo; Amid all this surrounding
desolation was Sheridan--the child of a few brief
months of existence, and destined to perish almost
as quickly--the centre of the grim picture, a mere
cluster of rude, unpainted houses, poorly erected
shacks, grimy tents flapping in the never ceasing wind
swirling across the treeless waste, the ugly red station,
the rough cow-pens filled with lowing cattle, the
huge, ungainly stores, their false fronts decorated
by amateur wielders of the paint brush, and the garish
dens of vice tucked in everywhere. The pendulum of
life never ceased swinging. Society was mixed; no
man cared who his neighbor was, or dared to question.
Of women worthy the name there were few, yet there
were flitting female forms in plenty, the saloon lights
revealing powdered cheeks and painted eyebrows. It
was a strange, restless populace, the majority here
to-day, disappearing to-morrow--cowboys, half-breeds,
trackmen, graders, desperadoes, gamblers, saloon-keepers,
merchants, generally Jewish, petty officials, and
a riff-raff no one could account for, mere floating
debris. The town was an eddy catching odd bits of
driftwood such as only the frontier ever knew. Queer
characters were everywhere, wrecks of dissipation,
derelicts of the East, seeking nothing save oblivion.</p>

<p>Everything was primitive--passion and pleasure ruled.
To spend easily made money noisily, brazenly, was
the ideal. From dawn to dawn the search after joy
continued. The bagnios and dance halls were ablaze;
the bar-rooms crowded with hilarious or quarrelsome
humanity, the gambling tables alive with excitement.
Men swaggered along the streets looking for trouble,
and generally finding it; cowboys rode into open saloon
doors and drank in the saddle; troops of congenial
spirits, frenzied with liquor, spurred recklessly
through the street firing into the air, or the crowd,
as their whim led; bands played popular airs on balconies,
and innumerable &ldquo;barkers&rdquo; added their
honeyed invitations to the perpetual din. From end
to end it was a saturnalia of vice, a babel of sound,
a glimpse of the inferno. Money flowed like water;
every man was his own law, and the gun the arbiter
of destiny. The town marshal, with a few cool-headed
deputies, moved here and there amid the chaos, patient,
tireless, undaunted, seeking merely to exercise some
slight restraint. This was Sheridan.</p>

<p>Into the one long street just at dusk rode Keith and
Neb, the third horse trailing behind. Already lights
were beginning to gleam in the crowded saloons, and
they were obliged to proceed slowly. Leaving the negro
at the corral to find some purchaser for the animals,
and such accommodations for himself as he could achieve,
Keith shouldered his way on foot through the heterogeneous
mass toward the only hotel, a long two-storied wooden
 structure, unpainted, fronting the glitter of the
Pioneer Dance Hall opposite. A noisy band was splitting
the air with discordant notes, a loud-voiced &ldquo;barker&rdquo;
yelling through the uproar, but Keith, accustomed to
similar scenes and sounds elsewhere, strode through
the open door of the hotel, and guided by the noisy,
continuous clatter of dishes, easily found his way
to the dining-room. It was crowded with men, a few
women scattered here and there, most of the former
in shirt-sleeves, all eating silently. A few smaller
tables at the back of the room were distinguished from
the others by white coverings in place of oil-cloth,
evidently reserved for the more distinguished guests.
Disdaining ceremony, the newcomer wormed his way through,
finally discovering a vacant seat where his back would
be to the wall, thus enabling him to survey the entire
apartment.</p>

<p>It was not of great interest, save for its constant
change and the primitive manner in which the majority
attacked their food supply, which was piled helter-skelter
upon the long tables, yet he ran his eyes searchingly
over the numerous faces, seeking impartially for either
friend or enemy. No countenance present, as revealed
in the dim light of the few swinging lamps, appeared
familiar, and satisfied that he remained unknown,
Keith began devoting his attention to the dishes before
him, mentally expressing his opinion as to their attractiveness.
Chancing finally to again lift his eyes, he met the
gaze of a man sitting directly opposite, a man who
somehow did not seem exactly in harmony with his surroundings.
He was short and stockily built, with round rosy face,
and a perfect shock of wiry hair brushed back from
a broad forehead; his nose wide but stubby, and chin
massive. Apparently he was between forty and fifty
years of age, exceedingly well dressed, his gray eyes
shrewd and full of a grim humor. Keith observed all
this in a glance, becoming aware at the same time that
his neighbor was apparently studying him also. The
latter broke silence with a quick, jerky utterance,
which seemed to peculiarly fit his personal appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn it all--know you, sir--sure I do--but
for life of me can&rsquo;t tell where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith stared across at him more searchingly, and replied,
rather indifferently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably a mistake then, as I have no recollection
of your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never make a mistake, sir--never forget a face,&rdquo;
the other snapped with some show of indignation, his
hands now clasped on the table, one stubby forefinger
pointed, as he leaned forward. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell
me--I&rsquo;ve seen you somewhere--no, not a word--don&rsquo;t
even tell me your name--I&rsquo;m going to think of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith smiled, not unwilling to humor the man&rsquo;s
eccentricity, and returned to his meal, with only
an occasional inquiring glance across the table. The
other sat and stared at him, his heavy eyebrows wrinkled,
as he struggled to awaken memory. The younger man
had begun on his pie when the face opposite suddenly
cleared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn me, I&rsquo;ve got it--hell, yes; hospital
tent--Shenandoah--bullet imbedded under third rib--ordinary
case--that&rsquo;s why I forgot--clear as mud now--get
the name in a minute--Captain--Captain Keith--that&rsquo;s
it--shake hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Puzzled at the unexpected recognition, yet realizing
the friendliness of the man, Keith grasped the pudgy
fingers extended with some cordiality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t remember me I s&rsquo;pose--don&rsquo;t
think you ever saw me--delirious when I came--hate
to tell you what you was talking about--gave you hypodermic
first thing--behaved well enough though when I dug
out the lead--Mini&eacute; bullet, badly blunted hitting
the rib--thought you might die with blood poison--couldn&rsquo;t
stay to see--too damn much to do--evidently didn&rsquo;t
though--remember me now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, only from what you say. You must have been
at General Waite&rsquo;s headquarters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it--charge of Stonewall&rsquo;s
field hospital--just happened to ride into Waite&rsquo;s
camp that night--damn lucky for you I did--young snip
there wanted to saw the bone--I stopped that--liked
your face--imagined you might be worth saving--ain&rsquo;t
so sure of it now, or you wouldn&rsquo;t be out in
this God forsaken country, eating such grub--my name&rsquo;s
Fairbain--Joseph Wright Fairbain, M.D.--contract surgeon
for the railroad--working on the line?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith shook his head, feeling awakening interest in
his peculiar companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; just drifted in here from down on the Arkansas,&rdquo;
he explained, briefly. &ldquo;Did you know General
Waite was dead?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s ruddy face whitened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead?--Willis Waite dead?&rdquo; he repeated.
&ldquo;What do you mean, sir? Are you sure? When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to be sure; I buried him just this
side the Cimmaron Crossing out on the Santa F&eacute; trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you know it was General Waite?&rdquo;
the man&rsquo;s insistent tone full of doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no question about it,&rdquo; returned
Keith, conclusively. &ldquo;The man was Waite&rsquo;s
size and general appearance, with gray beard, similar
to the one I remember he wore during the war. He had
been scalped, and his face beaten beyond recognition,
but papers in his pockets were sufficient to prove
his identity. Besides, he and his companion--a young
fellow named Sibley--were known to have pulled out
two days before from Carson City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ten days ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairbain&rsquo;s lips smiled, the ruddy coloring sweeping
back into his cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn me, Keith, you came near giving me a shock,&rdquo;
he said, jerkily. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t be so careless--not
sure my heart&rsquo;s just right--tendency to apoplexy,
too--got to be guarded against. Now, let me tell you
something-- maybe you buried some poor devil out at
Cimmaron Crossing--but it wasn&rsquo;t Willis Waite.
How do I know? Because I saw him, and talked with him
yesterday--damn me, if I didn&rsquo;t, right here in
this town.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XVII"></a>Chapter XVII</h1>

<h2>In the Next Room</h2>

<p>Keith, his eyes filled with undisguised doubt, studied
the face of the man opposite, almost convinced that
he was, in some way, connected with the puzzling mystery.
But the honesty of the rugged face only added to his
perplexity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you certain you are not mistaken?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I am, Keith. I&rsquo;ve known Waite
for fifteen years a bit intimately--have met him frequently
since the war--and I certainly talked with him. He
told me enough to partially confirm your story. He
said he had started for Santa F&eacute; light, because he
couldn&rsquo;t get enough men to run a caravan--afraid
of Indians, you know. So, he determined to take money--buy Mexican goods--and risk it himself. Old fighting
cock wouldn&rsquo;t turn back for all the Indians
on the plains once he got an idea in his head--he
was that kind--Lord, you ought to seen the fight he
put up at Spottsylvania! He got to Carson City with
two wagons, a driver and a cook --had eight thousand
dollars with him, too, the damn fool. Cook got into
row, gambling, cut a man, and was jugged. Old Waite
wouldn&rsquo;t leave even a nigger in that sort of
fix--natural fighter--likes any kind of row. So, he
hung on there at Carson, but had sense enough--Lord
knows where he got it --to put all but a few hundred
dollars in Ben Levy&rsquo;s safe. Then, he went out
one night to play poker with his driver and a friend--had
a drink or two--doped, probably, and never woke up
for forty-eight hours--lost clothes, money, papers,
and whole outfit--was just naturally cleaned out--couldn&rsquo;t get a trace worth following after. You
ought to have heard him cuss when he told me--it seemed
to be the papers that bothered him most-- them, and
the mules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say there was no trace?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to travel on after forty-eight hours--a
posse started out next morning, soon as they found
him--when they got back they reported having run the
fellows as far as Cimmaron Crossing--there they got
across into the sand hills, and escaped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who led the posse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man called Black, I think,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Black Bart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the name; so, I reckon you
didn&rsquo;t bury Willis Waite this time, Captain.
You wouldn&rsquo;t have thought he was a dead one if
you had heard him swear while he was telling the story--it
did him proud; never heard him do better since the
second day at Gettysburg--had his ear shot off then,
and I had to fix him up--Lord, but he called me a few
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith sat silent, fully convinced now that the doctor
was telling the truth, yet more puzzled than ever
over the peculiar situation in which he found himself
involved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What brought the General up here?&rdquo; he
questioned, finally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much idea,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I asked him directly. I
wasn&rsquo;t much interested. There was a hint dropped,
however, now you speak about it. He&rsquo;s keen after
those papers, and doesn&rsquo;t feel satisfied regarding
the report of the posse. It&rsquo;s my opinion he&rsquo;s
trailing after Black Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dining-room was thinning out, and they were about
the only ones left at the tables. Keith stretched
himself, looking around.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Doctor, I am very glad to have met you
again, and to learn Waite is actually alive. This
is a rather queer affair, but will have to work itself
out. Anyway, I am too dead tired to-night to hunt after
clues in midst of this babel. I&rsquo;ve been in the
saddle most of the time for a week, and have got to
find a bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon you won&rsquo;t discover such a thing
here,&rdquo; dryly. &ldquo;Got seven in a room upstairs,
and others corded along the hall. Better share my cell--only thing to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be asking too much--I can turn in
at the corral with Neb; I&rsquo;ve slept in worse
places.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t think of it, Keith,&rdquo; and
the doctor got up. &ldquo;Besides, you sleep at night,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Usually, yes,&rdquo; the other admitted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t bother me any--no doctor
sleeps at night in Sheridan; that&rsquo;s our harvest
time. Come on, and I&rsquo;ll show you the way. When
morning comes I&rsquo;ll rout you out and take my
turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith had enjoyed considerable experience in frontier
hotels, but nothing before had ever quite equalled
this, the pride of Sheridan. The product of a mushroom
town, which merely existed by grace of the temporary
railway terminus, it had been hastily and flimsily
constructed, so it could be transported elsewhere
at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Every creak of a bed echoed
from wall to wall. The thin partitions often failed
to reach the ceiling by a foot or two, and the slightest
noise aroused the entire floor. And there was noise
of every conceivable kind, in plenty, from the blare
of a band at the Pioneer Dance Hall opposite, to the
energetic cursing of the cook in the rear. A discordant
din of voices surged up from the street below--laughter,
shouts, the shrieks of women, a rattle of dice, an
occasional pistol shot, and the continuous yelling
of industrious &ldquo;barkers.&rdquo; There was no
safety anywhere. An exploding revolver in No. 47 was
quite likely to disturb the peaceful slumbers of the
innocent occupant of No. 15, and every sound of quarrel
in the thronged bar-room below caused the lodger to
curl up in momentary expectation of a stray bullet
coursing toward him through the floor. With this to
trouble him, he could lie there and hear everything
that occurred within and without. Every creak, stamp,
and snore was faithfully reported; every curse, blow,
snarl reechoed to his ears. Inside was hell; outside
was Sheridan.</p>

<p>Wearied, and half dead, as Keith was, sleep was simply
impossible. He heard heavy feet tramping up and down
the hall; once a drunken man endeavored vainly to
open his door; not far away there was a scuffle, and
the sound of a body falling down stairs. In some distant
apartment a fellow was struggling to draw off his
tight boots, skipping about on one foot amid much
profanity. That the boot conquered was evident when
the man crawled into the creaking bed, announcing
defiantly, &ldquo;If the landlord wants them boots
off, let him come an&rsquo; pull &rsquo;em off.&rdquo;
Across the hall was a rattle of chips, and the voices
of several men, occasionally raised in anger. Now
and then they would stamp on the floor as an order
for liquid refreshments from below. From somewhere
beyond, the long-drawn melancholy howl of a distressed
dog greeted the rising moon.</p>

<p>Out from all this pandemonium Keith began to unconsciously
detect the sound of voices talking in the room to
his left. In the lull of obstructing sound a few words
reached him through the slight open space between
wall and ceiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hell, Bill, what&rsquo;s the use goin&rsquo;
out again when we haven&rsquo;t the price?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we might find Bart somewhere, and he&rsquo;d
stake us. I guess I know enough to make him loosen
up. Come on; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not me; this town is too near Fort Hays; I&rsquo;m
liable to run into some of the fellows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A chair scraped across the floor as Bill arose to
his feet; evidently from the noise he had been drinking,
but Keith heard him lift the latch of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Willoughby,&rdquo; he said, thickly,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try my luck, an&rsquo; if I see
Bart I&rsquo;ll tell him yer here. So long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shuffled along the hall and went, half sliding,
down stairs, and Keith distinguished the click of
glass and bottle in the next room. He was sitting
up in bed now, wide awake, obsessed with a desire to
investigate. The reference overheard must have been
to Hawley, and if so, this Willoughby, who was afraid
of meeting soldiers from the fort, would be the deserter
Miss Hope was seeking. There could be no harm in making
sure, and he slipped into his clothes, and as silently
as possible, unlatched his door. There was a noisy
crowd at the farther end of the hall, and the sound
of some one laboriously mounting the stairs. Not desiring
to be seen, Keith slipped swiftly toward the door
of the other room, and tried the latch. It was unfastened,
and he stepped quietly within, closing it behind him.</p>

<p>A small lamp was on the washstand, a half-emptied
bottle and two glasses beside it, while a pack of
cards lay scattered on the floor. Fully dressed, except
for a coat, the sole occupant lay on the bed, but started
up at Keith&rsquo;s unceremonious entrance, reaching
for his revolver, which had slipped to the wrong side
of his belt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the hell!&rdquo; he exclaimed, startled
and confused.</p>

<p>The intruder took one glance at him through the dingy
light--a boy of eighteen, dark hair, dark eyes, his
face, already exhibiting signs of dissipation, yet
manly enough in chin and mouth--and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could draw while you were thinking about
it,&rdquo; he said, easily, &ldquo;but I am not here
on the fight. Are you Fred Willoughby?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lad stared at him, his uncertain hand now closed
on the butt of his revolver, yet held inactive by
the other&rsquo;s quiet assurance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want to know for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Curiosity largely; thought I&rsquo;d like to
ask you a question or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You--you&rsquo;re not from the fort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to do with the army; this is a private
affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy was sullen from drink, his eyes heavy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who the devil are you? I never saw you
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very true, and my name wouldn&rsquo;t
help any. Nevertheless, you&rsquo;re perfectly welcome
to it. I am Jack Keith.&rdquo; No expression of recognition
came into the face of the other, and Keith added curtly,
&ldquo;Shall we talk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and then Willoughby
swung his feet over the edge of the bed onto the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; he said shortly, &ldquo;until
I see what the game is about.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Interviewing Willoughby</h2>

<p>Cooly, yet without in the least comprehending how
best to proceed, Keith drew toward him the only chair
in the room, and sat down. Miss Hope--more widely
known as Christie Maclaire--had claimed this drunken
lad as her brother, but, according to Hawley, he had
vehemently denied any such relationship. Yet there
must be some previous association between the two,
and what this was the plainsman proposed to discover.
The problem was how best to cause the fellow to talk
frankly--could he be reached more easily by reference
to the girl or the gambler? Keith studying the sullen,
obstinate face confronting him, with instinctive antagonism
over his intrusion, swiftly determined on the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was not very nice of me to come in on you
this way,&rdquo; he began, apologetically, &ldquo;but
you see I happen to know your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister? Oh, I guess not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I do,&rdquo; throwing a confidence
into his tone he was far from feeling, &ldquo;Miss
Hope and I are friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy sprang to his feet, his face flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean Hope? Do you know her? Say, I
thought you were giving me that old gag about Christie
Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; who is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more than I know; fellow came
to me at Carson, and said he&rsquo;d met my sister
on a stage west of Topeka. I knew he was lyin&rsquo;,
because she&rsquo;s home over in Missouri. Finally,
I got it out of him that she claimed to be my sister,
but her name was Maclaire. Why, I don&rsquo;t even
know her, and what do you suppose she ever picked
me out for her brother for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was plainly puzzled, and perfectly convinced it
was all a mistake. That his sister might have left
home since he did, and drifted West under an assumed
name, apparently never occurred to him as possible.
To Keith this was the explanation, and nothing could
be more natural, considering her work, yet he did
not feel like shattering the lad&rsquo;s loyalty. Faith
in the sister might yet save him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the fellow who told you,&rdquo; he
hazarded blindly, speaking the first thought which
came to his mind, &ldquo;had some reason to desire
to make you think this Maclaire girl was your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The suggestion caused him to laugh at first; then
his face suddenly sobered, as though a new thought
had occurred to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn me, no, it couldn&rsquo;t be that,&rdquo;
he exclaimed, one hand pressing his head. &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t be workin&rsquo; no trick of that kind
on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fellow named Hawley,&rdquo; evasively. &ldquo;The
man who claimed to have met my sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; Hawley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy lifted his head again, his eyes filled with
suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if you must know; he&rsquo;s a gambler
all right, but he&rsquo;s stuck to me when I was down
and out. You know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; carelessly; &ldquo;but
what sort of a trick could he be working trying to
make you acknowledge Christie Maclaire as your sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Willoughby did not answer, shifting uneasily about
on the bed. Keith waited, and at last the boy blurted
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t nothing much. I told him
something when I was drunk once, that I thought maybe
might have stuck to him. Odd he should make that mistake,
too, for I showed him Hope&rsquo;s picture. Bart&rsquo;s
a schemer, and I didn&rsquo;t know but what he might
have figured out a trick, though I don&rsquo;t see
how he could. It wasn&rsquo;t no more than a pipe dream,
I reckon. Where did you meet Hope? Back in Missouri?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thing was clearly evident--the boy&rsquo;s faith
in his sister. If he was to be rightly influenced,
and led back to her, he must have no suspicion aroused
that her life was any different from what it had been
before he left home. Besides if Keith hoped to gain
any inkling of what Hawley&rsquo;s purpose could be,
he must win the confidence of Willoughby. This could
not be done by telling him of Hope&rsquo;s present
life. These considerations  flashed through his mind,
and as swiftly determined his answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve known her some time. Not long
ago I did her a service for which she is grateful.
Did you know she was out in this country searching
for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out here? In Kansas?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure; that isn&rsquo;t much of a trip for a
spirited girl. She got it in her head from your letters
that you were in trouble, and set out to find you
and bring you home. She didn&rsquo;t tell me this,
but that is the way I heard it. It was for her sake
I came in here. Why not go to her, Willoughby, and
then both of you return to Missouri?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sullenness had gone out of the boy&rsquo;s face:
he looked tired, discouraged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Hope?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fort Larned, I suppose. She went to Carson
City first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that settles it,&rdquo; shaking his head.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose I could go browsin&rsquo;
&rsquo;round Larned, and not get snapped up, do you?
They don&rsquo;t chase deserters very far out here,
but that&rsquo;s the post I skipped from, and they&rsquo;d
jug me all right. Besides, I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll
go back until I get a stake. I want to see a fellow
first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s Hawley, if you want to know
so bad. He said if I would come here and wait for
him he&rsquo;d put me on to a good thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy fidgetted along the edge of the bed, evidently
half ashamed of himself, yet obstinate and unyielding.
Keith sat watching his face, unable to evolve any
means of changing his decision. Hawley&rsquo;s influence
just at present was greater than Hope&rsquo;s, because
the lad naturally felt ashamed to go slinking home
penniless and defeated. His pride held him to Hawley,
and his faith that the man would redeem his promise.
Keith understood all this readily enough, and comprehended
also that if &ldquo;Black Bart&rdquo; had any use for
the boy it would be for some criminal purpose. What
was it? Was there a deeply laid plot back of all these
preparations involving both Willoughby and his sister?
What was it Hawley was scheming about so carefully,
holding this boy deserter in one hand, while he reached
out the other after Christie Maclaire? Surely, the
man was not working blindly; he must have a purpose
in view. Willoughby had acknowledged he had told the
fellow something once when he was drunk--about his
family history, no doubt, for he had shown him Hope&rsquo;s
picture. What that family secret was Keith had no
means of guessing, but Hawley, the moment he saw the
face on the cardboard, had evidently recognized Christie
Maclaire--had thought of some way in which what he
now knew could be turned to advantage. The few scattered
facts which Keith had collected all seemed to point
to such a conclusion--Hawley had sent the boy to Sheridan,
where he would be out of sight, with orders to wait
for him there, and the promise of a &ldquo;stake&rdquo;
to keep him quiet. Then he had gone to Independence
and Topeka seeking after Christie Maclaire. Evidently
he meant to keep the two apart until he had gained
from each whatever it was he sought. But what could
that be? What family secret could Willoughby have
blurted out in his cups, which had so stimulated the
gambler&rsquo;s wits?</p>

<p>Two things combined to cause Keith to determine he
would uncover this rascality,--his desire to repay
Hawley, and his interest in the girl rescued on the
Salt Fork. This gossamer web of intrigue into which
he had stumbled unwittingly was nothing to him personally;
had it not involved both Hawley and Miss Hope, he
would have left it unsolved without another thought.
But under the circumstances it became his own battle.
There was a crime here--hidden as yet, and probably
not consummated--involving wrong, perhaps disgrace,
to the young girl. He had rescued her once from out
the clutches of this man, and he had no intention
of deserting her now. Whatever her life might be,
she was certainly an innocent victim in this case,
deserving his protection. The memory came to him of
her face upturned toward him in that little room of
the Occidental, her eyes tear-dimmed, her lips asking
him to come back to her again. He could not believe
her a bad woman, and his lips compressed, his eyes
darkened, with fixed determination. He would dig into
this until he uncovered the truth; he would find out
what dirty trick &ldquo;Black Bart&rdquo; was up to.</p>

<p>As he thought this out, not swiftly as recorded, but
slowly, deliberately, piecing the bits together within
his mind, blindly feeling his way to a final conclusion,
the boy had sunk back upon the bed, overcome with
liquor, and fallen asleep. Keith stepped over, and
looked down upon him in the dim light. He could recognize
something of her features in the upturned face, and
his eyes softened. There was no use seeking again to
arouse him; even had he been sober, he would not have
talked freely. Keith lifted the dangling feet into
a more comfortable position, turned the lamp lower,
went out, and latched the door. Two men were tramping
heavily up the stairs, and they turned into the hall
at the very moment he disappeared within his own room.
He still retained his grasp upon the latch, when a
voice outside asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What number did you say, Bill--29?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith straightened up as though suddenly pricked by
a knife; he could never forget that voice--it was
Hawley&rsquo;s.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XIX"></a>Chapter XIX</h1>

<h2>A Glimpse at Conspiracy</h2>

<p>Leaning against the inside of his own door, startled
by the rapid sequence of events, Keith was able, from
different sounds reaching him, to mentally picture
most of what occurred in the next room. He heard Bill
sink down into the convenient chair, and drink from
the bottle, while the gambler apparently advanced
toward the bed, where he stood looking down on its
unconscious occupant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fool is dead drunk,&rdquo; he declared
disgustedly. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do anything with
him to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say--throw bucket water over him,&rdquo;
hiccoughed the other genially, &ldquo;allers sobers
me off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawley made no response, evidently finding a seat
on one end of the washstand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly worth while, Scott,&rdquo; he returned
finally. &ldquo;Perhaps I better have some understanding
with Christie, anyhow, before I pump the boy any further.
If we can once get her working with us, Willoughby
won&rsquo;t have much hand in the play--we shan&rsquo;t
need him. Thought I told you to keep sober?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am sober,&rdquo; solemnly, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t
had but six drinks; just nat&rsquo;rly tired out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed; well, such a room as this would
drive any man to drink. Did you get what I sent you
here after?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure did, Bart,&rdquo; and Keith heard the
fellow get to his feet unsteadily. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
the picture, an&rsquo; some letters. I didn&rsquo;t
take only what he had in the grip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawley shuffled the letters over in his hands, apparently
hastily reading them with some difficulty in the dim
light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing there to give us any help,&rdquo; he
acknowledged reluctantly, &ldquo;mostly advice as
far as I can see. Damn the light; a glow worm would
be better.&rdquo; There was a pause; then he slapped
his leg. &ldquo;However, it&rsquo;s clear they live
in Springfield, Missouri, and this photograph is a
peach. Just look here, Bill! What did I tell you?
Ain&rsquo;t Christie a dead ringer for this girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet she is, Bart,&rdquo; admitted the other
in maudlin admiration, &ldquo;only, I reckon, maybe
some older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she ought to be accordin&rsquo; to Willoughby&rsquo;s
story, an&rsquo; them papers bear him out all right,
so I reckon he&rsquo;s told it straight--this Phyllis
would be twenty-six now, and that&rsquo;s just about
what Christie is. It wouldn&rsquo;t have fit better
if we had made it on purpose. If the girl will only
play up to the part we won&rsquo;t need any other evidence--her
face would be enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith could hear the beating of his own heart in the
silence that followed. Here was a new thought, a new
understanding, a complete new turn to affairs. Christie
Maclaire, then, was not Willoughby&rsquo;s sister Hope.
The girl he rescued on the desert--the girl with the
pleading brown eyes, and the soft blur of the South
on her lips--was not the music hall singer. He could
hardly grasp the truth at first, it antagonized so
sharply with all he had previously believed. Yet,
if this were true his own duty became clearer than
ever; aye, and would be more willingly performed. But
what did Hawley know? Did he already realize that
the girl he had first met on the stage coach, and
later inveigled into the desert, was Hope, and not
the music hall artist? He, of course, fully believed
her to be Christie Maclaire at that time, but something
might have occurred since to change that belief. Anyhow,
the man was not now seeking Hope, but the other. Apparently
the latter was either already here in Sheridan or expected
soon. And exactly what was it the gambler desired this
Maclaire woman to do? This was the important matter,
and for its solution Keith possessed merely a few
hints, a few vague suggestions. She was expected to
represent herself as Phyllis--Phyllis who? Some Phyllis
surely whose physical resemblance to Hope must be
sufficiently marked to be at once noticeable. Willoughby
had evidently revealed to Hawley some hidden family
secret, having money involved, no doubt, and in which
the discovery of this mysterious Phyllis figured.
She might, perhaps, be a sister, or half-sister,
who had disappeared, and remained ignorant as to any
inheritance. Hope&rsquo;s picture shown by the boy,
and reminding Hawley at once of Christie Maclaire,
had been the basis of the whole plot. Exactly what
the details of that plot might be Keith could not
figure out, but one thing was reasonably certain--it
was proposed to defraud Hope. And who in the very
truth was Hope? It suddenly occurred to him as a remarkably
strange fact that he possessed not the slightest inkling
as to the girl&rsquo;s name. Her brother had assumed
to be called Willoughby when he enlisted in the army,
and his companions continued to call him this. If he
could interview the girl now for only five minutes
he should be able probably to straighten out the whole
intricate tangle. But where was she? Would she have
remained until this time at Fort Larned with Kate
Murphy?</p>

<p>There was a noise of movement in the next room. Apparently
as Hawley arose carelessly from his edge of the washstand
he had dislodged the glass, which fell shivering on
the floor. Scott swore audibly at the loss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Bill,&rdquo; snapped the gambler,
irritated, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got the bottle left.
I&rsquo;m going; there&rsquo;s nothing for any of us
to do now, until after I see Christie. You remain
here! Do you understand?--remain here. Damn me, if
that drunken fool isn&rsquo;t waking up.&rdquo; There
was a rattling of the rickety bed, and then the sound
of Willoughby&rsquo;s voice, thick from liquor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Almighty glad see you, Bart--am, indeed. Want
money--Bill an&rsquo; I both want money--can&rsquo;t
drink without money--can&rsquo;t eat without money--shay,
when you goin&rsquo; stake us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you again in the morning, Fred,&rdquo;
returned the other briefly. &ldquo;Go on back to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will when I git good an&rsquo; ready--go sleep,
stay wake, just as I please-- don&rsquo;t care damn
what yer do--got new frien&rsquo; now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new friend? Who?&rdquo; Hawley spoke with
aroused interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s all right--he&rsquo;s mighty
fine fellow--come in wisout in-- invitation--ol&rsquo;
friend my sister--called--called her Hope--you fool,
Bart Hawley, think my sister Christie--Christie--damfino
the name--my sister, Hope--don&rsquo;t want yer money--my--my
new friend, he &rsquo;ll stake me--he knows my sister--Hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gambler grasped the speaker, shaking him into
some slight semblance of sobriety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Willoughby, I want the truth,
and mean to have it,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Has
some one been in here while Scott was gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure--didn&rsquo;t I just tell yer?--friend
o&rsquo; Hope&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was he? Speak up! I want the name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a faint gurgling sound, as though the gambler&rsquo;s
vise-like fingers were at the boy&rsquo;s throat;
a slight struggle, and then the choked voice gasped
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let up! damn yer! He called himself Jack Keith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dead silence which ensued was broken only by heavy
breathing. Then Scott swore, bringing his fist down
with a crash on the washstand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That rather stumps yer, don&rsquo;t it, Bart?
Well, it don&rsquo;t me. I tell yer it&rsquo;s just
as I said from the first. It was Keith an&rsquo; that
nigger what jumped ye in the cabin. They was hidin&rsquo;
there when we rode in. He just nat&rsquo;rly pumped
the gal, an&rsquo; now he&rsquo;s up here trailin&rsquo;
you. Blame it all, it makes me laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you see to laugh at.
This Keith isn&rsquo;t an easy man to play with, let
me tell you. He may have got on to our game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell, Bart, don&rsquo;t lose your nerve.
He can&rsquo;t do anything, because we&rsquo;ve got
the under holt. He&rsquo;s a fugitive; all we got to
do is locate him, an&rsquo; have him flung back inter
jail--there&rsquo;s murder an&rsquo; hoss-stealing
agin him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawley seemed to be thinking swiftly, while his companion
took another drink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, pard, ain&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that trick won&rsquo;t work, Scott. We
could do it easily enough if we were down in Carson,
where the boys would help us out. The trouble up here
is that &lsquo;Wild Bill&rsquo; Hickock is Marshal
of Sheridan, and he and I never did hitch. Besides,
Keith was one of his deputies down at Dodge two years
ago --you remember when Dutch Charlie&rsquo;s place
was cleaned out? Well, Hickock and Keith did that
job all alone, and &lsquo;Wild Bill&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t
going back on that kind of a pal, is he? I tell you
we&rsquo;ve got to fight this affair alone, and on
the quiet. Maybe the fellow don&rsquo;t know much yet,
but he&rsquo;s sure on the trail, or else he wouldn&rsquo;t
have been in here talking to Willoughby. We&rsquo;ve
got to get him, Scott, somehow. Lord, man, there&rsquo;s
a clean million dollars waiting for us in this deal,
and I&rsquo;m ready to fight for it. But I&rsquo;m
damned sleepy, and I&rsquo;m going to bed. You locate
Keith to-morrow, and then, when you&rsquo;re sober,
we&rsquo;ll figure out how we can get to him best;
I&rsquo;ve got to set Christie right. Good-night,
Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went out into the hall and down the creaking stairs,
the man he wanted so badly listening to his descending
footsteps, half tempted to follow. Scott did not move,
perhaps had already fallen drunkenly asleep on his
chair, and finally Keith crossed his own room, and
lay down. The din outside continued unabated, but
the man&rsquo;s intense weariness overcame it all,
and he fell asleep, his last conscious thought a memory
of Hope.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XX"></a>Chapter XX</h1>

<h2>Hope Goes to Sheridan</h2>

<p>The discovery of the locket which had fallen from
about Keith&rsquo;s neck made it impossible for Hope
to remain quietly for very long in the hotel at Fort
Larned. The more carefully she thought over the story
of that murder at the Cimmaron Crossing, and Keith&rsquo;s
tale of how he had discovered and buried the mutilated
bodies, the more assured she became that that was
where this locket came from, and that the slain freighter
must have been her own father. She never once questioned
the truth of Keith&rsquo;s report; there was that
about the man which would not permit of her doubting
him. He had simply failed to mention what he removed
from the bodies, supposing this would be of no special
interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy, hoping thus to quiet the apprehensions
of her charge, set herself diligently at work to discover
the facts. As her house was filled with transients,
including occasional visitors from Carson City, and
was also lounging headquarters for many of the officers
from the near-by fort, she experienced no difficulty
in picking up all the floating rumors. Out of these,
with Irish shrewdness, she soon managed to patch together
a consistent fabric of fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shure, honey, it&rsquo;s not so bad the way
they tell it now,&rdquo; she explained, consolingly.
&ldquo;Nobody belaves now it was yer father that got
kilt. It was two fellers what stole his outfit, clothes
an&rsquo; all, an&rsquo; was drivin&rsquo; off wid
&rsquo;em inter the sand hills. Divil a wan does know
who kilt &rsquo;em, but there&rsquo;s some ugly stories
travellin&rsquo; about. Some says Injuns; some says
the posse run &rsquo;em down; an&rsquo; Black Bart
an&rsquo; his dirthy outfit, they swear it was Keith.
Oi&rsquo;ve got me own notion. Annyhow, there&rsquo;s
&rsquo;bout three hundred dollars, some mules, an&rsquo;
a lot o&rsquo; valyble papers missin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it wasn&rsquo;t father, where is he
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Oi&rsquo;ve been tryin&rsquo;
ter foind out. First off he went out to the Cimmaron
Crossing, gyarded by a squad o&rsquo; cavalry from
the fort here. Tommy Caine wint along, an&rsquo; told
me all about it. They dug up the bodies, but niver
a thing did they find on &rsquo;em--not a paper, nor
a dollar. They&rsquo;d bin robbed all roight. The
owld Gineral swore loike a wild mon all the way back,
Tommy said, an&rsquo; the first thing he did at Carson
City was to start huntin&rsquo; fer &lsquo;Black Bart.&rsquo;
He was two days gittin&rsquo; on the trail av him;
then he heard the feller was gone away trapsing after
a singin&rsquo; or dancin&rsquo; gyurl called Christie
Maclaire. She was supposed to be ayther at Topeky or
Sheridan. A freighter told the owld man she was at
Sheridan, an&rsquo; so he started there overland,
hopin&rsquo; ter head off &lsquo;Black Bart.&rsquo;
Oi reckon we could a towld mor &rsquo;n that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why shure, honey, what&rsquo;s the use tryin&rsquo;
ter d&eacute;cave me? Didn&rsquo;t Jack Keith, wid his own
lips, tell me ye was Christie Maclaire?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not! I&rsquo;m not, Mrs. Murphy.
I don&rsquo;t even know the woman. It is such a strange
thing; I cannot account for it--both those men mistook
me for her, and--and I let them. I didn&rsquo;t care
who the man Hawley supposed me to be, but I intended
to have told Mr. Keith he was mistaken. I don&rsquo;t
know why I didn&rsquo;t, only I supposed he finally
understood. But I want you to believe, Mrs. Murphy--I
am Hope Waite, and not Christie Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little the loss to ye not ter be
her, an&rsquo; Oi&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; loikely Jack
Keith will be moighty well plased ter know the truth.
What&rsquo;s &lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; so ayger ter
git hold av this Maclaire gyurl fer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not in the least know. He must have induced
me to go to that place in the desert believing me
to be the other woman. Yet he said nothing of any
purpose; indeed, he found no opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy shook her head disparagingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was shure some divilment,&rdquo; she asserted,
stoutly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be up to some thrick wid
the poor gyurl; Oi know the loikes av him. Shure, the
two av yez must look as much aloike as two pay&eacute;s in
a pod. Loikely now, it&rsquo;s a twin sister ye&rsquo;ve
got?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hope smiled, although her eyes were misty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no; Fred and I were the only children;
but what shall I do? What ought I to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Irish mouth of Kate Murphy set firmly, her blue
eyes burning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not sthrong Oi am on advisin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
she said, shortly, &ldquo;but if it was me Oi&rsquo;d
be fer foindin&rsquo; out what all this mix-up was
about. There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; moighty quare
in it. It&rsquo;s my notion that Hawley&rsquo;s got
hold av thim papers av yer father&rsquo;s. The owld
gint thinks so, too, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s
so hot afther catchin&rsquo; him. May the divil admoire
me av Oi know where this Maclaire gyurl comes in,
but Oi&rsquo;ll bet the black divil has get her marked
fer some part in the play. What would Oi do? Be goory,
Oi&rsquo;d go to Sheridan, an&rsquo; foind the Gineral,
an&rsquo; till him all I knew. Maybe he could piece
it together, an&rsquo; guess what Hawley was up ter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hope was already upon her feet, her puzzled face brightening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is what I wanted to do, but I was
not sure it would be best. How can I get there from
here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d have ter take the stage back to
Topeky; loikely they&rsquo;d be runnin&rsquo; thrains
out from there on the new road. It&rsquo;ll be aisy
fer me ter foind out from some av the lads down below.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only equipment operating into Sheridan was a construction
train, with an old battered passenger coach coupled
to the rear. A squad of heavily armed infantrymen
rode along, as protection against possible Indian
raiders, but there was no crowd aboard on this special
trip, as all construction work had been suspended
on the line indefinitely, and most of the travel,
therefore, had changed to the eastward. The coach used
had a partition run through it, and, as soon as the
busy trainmen discovered ladies on board, they unceremoniously
drove the more bibulous passengers, protesting, into
the forward compartment. This left Hope in comparative
peace, her remaining neighbors quiet, taciturn men,
whom she looked at through the folds of her veil during
the long, slow, exasperating journey, mentally guessing
at their various occupations. It was an exceedingly
tedious, monotonous trip, the train slackening up,
and jerking forward, apparently without slightest
reason; then occasionally achieving a full stop, while
men, always under guard, went ahead to fix up some
bit of damaged track, across which the engineer dared
not advance. At each bridge spanning the numerous
small streams, trainmen examined the structure before
venturing forward, and at each stop the wearied passengers
grew more impatient and sarcastic, a perfect stream
of fluent profanity being wafted back whenever the
door between the two sections chanced to be left ajar.</p>

<p>Hope was not the only woman on board, yet a glance
at the others was sufficient to decide their status,
even had their freedom of manner and loud talking
not made it equally obvious. Fearful lest she might
be mistaken for one of the same class, she remained
in silence, her veil merely lifted enough to enable
her to peer out through the grimy window at the barren
view slipping slowly past. This consisted of the bare
prairie, brown and desolate, occasionally intersected
by some small watercourse, the low hills rising and
falling like waves to the far horizon. Few incidents
broke the dead monotony; occasionally a herd of antelope
appeared in the distance silhouetted against the sky-line,
and once they fairly crept for an hour through a mass
of buffalo, grazing so close that a fusillade of guns
sounded from the front end of the train. A little
farther along she caught a glimpse of a troop of wild
horses dashing recklessly down into a sheltering ravine.
Yet principally all that met her straining eyes was
sterile desolation. Here and there a great ugly water
tank reared its hideous shape beside the track, the
engine always pausing for a fresh supply. Beside it
was invariably a pile of coal, a few construction
cars, a hut half buried under earth, loop-holed and
barricaded, with several rough men loafing about, heavily
armed and inquisitive. A few of these points had once
been terminal, the surrounding scenery evidencing
past glories by piles of tin cans, and all manner of
debris, with occasionally a vacant shack, left deserted
and forlorn.</p>

<p>Wearied and heartsick, Hope turned away from this
outside dreariness to contemplate more closely her
neighbors on board, but found them scarcely more interesting.
Several were playing cards, others moodily staring
out of the windows, while a few wefe laughing and
talking with the girls, their conversation inane and
punctuated with profanity. One man was figuring on
a scratch pad, and Hope decided he must be an engineer
employed on the line; others she classed as small merchants,
saloon-keepers, and frontier riff-raff. They would
glance curiously at her as they marched up and down
the narrow aisle, but her veil, and averted face,
prevented even the boldest from speaking, Once she
addressed the conductor, and the man who was figuring
turned and looked back at her, evidently attracted
by the soft note of her voice. But he made no effort
at advances, returning immediately to his pad, oblivious
to all else.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk, the outside world, now consisting
of level plains, fading into darkness, with a few
great stars burning overhead. Trainsmen lit the few
smoking oil lamps screwed against the sides of the
car, and its occupants became little more than dim
shadows. All by this time were fatigued into silence,
and several were asleep, finding such small comfort
as was possible on the cramped seats. Hope glanced
toward the heretofore noisy group at the rear--the
girl nearest her rested with unconscious head pillowed
upon the shoulder of her man friend, and both were
sleeping. How haggard and ghastly the woman&rsquo;s
powdered face looked, with the light just above it,
and all semblance of joy gone. It was as though a mask
had been taken off. Out in the darkness the engine
whistled sharply and then came to a bumping stop at
some desert station. Through the black window a few
lanterns could be seen flickering about, and there
arose the sound of gruff voices speaking. The sleepers
inside, aroused by the sharp stop, rolled over and
swore, seeking easier postures. Then the front door
opened, and slammed shut, and a new passenger entered.
He came down the aisle, glancing carelessly at the
upturned faces, and finally sank into the seat directly
opposite Hope. He was a broad shouldered man, his coat
buttoned to the throat, with strong face showing clearly
beneath the broad hat brim and lighted up with a pair
of shrewd, kindly eyes. The conductor came through,
nodded at him, and passed on. Hope thought he must
be some official of the road, and ventured to break
the prolonged silence with a question:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could you tell me how long it will be before
we reach Sheridan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had partially pushed aside her veil in order to
speak more clearly, and the man, turning at sound
of her voice, took off his hat, his searching eyes
quizzical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I can&rsquo;t, madam,&rdquo; the
words coming with a jerk. &ldquo;For I&rsquo;m not
at all sure we&rsquo;ll keep the track. Ought to make
it in an hour, however, if everything goes right.
Live in Sheridan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head, uncertain how frankly to answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No loss to you--worst place to live in on earth--no
exceptions--I know-- been there myself three months--got
friends there likely?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly know,&rdquo; she acknowledged doubtfully.
&ldquo;I think so, but I shall have to hunt some place
in which to stay to-night. Can you tell me of some--some
respectable hotel, or boarding house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man wheeled about, until he could look at her
more clearly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pretty hard commission, Miss,&rdquo;
he returned uneasily: &ldquo;There may be such a place
in Sheridan, but I have never found it. Old Mother
Shattuck keeps roomers, but she won&rsquo;t have a
woman in the house. I reckon you &rsquo;ll have to
try it at the hotel--I&rsquo;ll get you in there if
I have to mesmerize the clerk--you&rsquo;ll find it
a bit noisy though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I thank you so much. I don&rsquo;t mind
the noise, so it is respectable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, good humoredly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I don&rsquo;t propose to vouch for that--the
proprietor ain&rsquo;t out there for his health--but,
I reckon, you won&rsquo;t have no serious trouble--the
boys mostly know a good woman when they see one--which
isn&rsquo;t often--anyhow, they&rsquo;re liable to
be decent enough as long as I vouch for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know nothing of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need to--your face is enough--I&rsquo;ll
get you the room all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated, then asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you--are you connected with the railroad??&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a way, yes--I&rsquo;m the contract surgeon--had
to dig a bullet out of a water-tank tender back yonder--fellow
howled as though I was killing him --no nerve--mighty
poor stuff most of the riff-raff out here--ball wasn&rsquo;t
in much below the skin--Indian must have plugged him
from the top of the bluff--blame good shot too--ragged
looking slug--like to see it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head energetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame you--nothing very uncommon--get
a dozen cases like it a day sometimes--stay in Sheridan,
show you something worth while--very pretty surgical
operation to-morrow--come round and get you if you
care to see it--got to open the stomach--don&rsquo;t
know what I&rsquo;ll find--like to go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I&rsquo;m sure you mean it all kindly,
but--but I would rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hardly supposed you would--only knew one woman
who cared for that sort of thing much--she was nursing
for me during the war--had a hare lip and an eye like
a dagger--good nurse though--rather have your kind
round me--ever nurse any? Could get you a dozen jobs
in Sheridan--new prospects every night--fifty dollars
a week--what do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not seeking work, Doctor,&rdquo;
smiling in spite of her bewilderment. &ldquo;I have
money enough with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t know--thought maybe you
wanted a job, and didn&rsquo;t like to ask for it--have
known &rsquo;em like that--no harm done--if you ever
do want anything like that, just come to me--my name&rsquo;s
Fairbain--everybody knows me here--operated on most
of &rsquo;em--rest expect to be--Damn that engineer.
I don&rsquo;t believe he knows whether he&rsquo;s
going ahead or backing up.&rdquo; He peered out of
the window, pressing his face hard against the glass.
&ldquo;I reckon that&rsquo;s Sheridan he&rsquo;s whistling
for now--don&rsquo;t be nervous--I&rsquo;ll see you
make the hotel all right.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Marshal of Sheridan</h2>

<p>It was called a depot merely through courtesy, consisting
of a layer of cinders, scattered promiscuously so
as to partially conceal the underlying mud, and a
dismantled box car, in which presided ticket agent
and telegrapher. A hundred yards below was the big
shack where the railroad officials lodged. Across
the tracks blazed invitingly the &ldquo;First Chance&rdquo;
saloon. All intervening space was crowded with men,
surging aimlessly about in the glare of a locomotive
head light, and greeting the alighting passengers
with free and easy badinage. Stranger or acquaintance
made no difference, the welcome to Sheridan was noisily
extended, while rough play and hoarse laughter characterized
the mass.</p>

<p>Hope paused on the step, even as Dr. Fairbain grasped
her hand, dinned by the medley of discordant sounds,
and confused by the vociferous jam of humanity. A
band came tooting down the street in a hack, a fellow,
with a voice like a fog horn, howling on the front
seat. The fellows at the side of the car surged aside
to get a glimpse of this new attraction, and Fairbain,
taking quick advantage of the opportunity thus presented,
swung his charge to the cinders below. Bending before
her, and butting his great shoulders into the surging
crowd, he succeeded in pushing a passage through,
thus finally bringing her forth to the edge of the
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, there,&rdquo; he said shortly, grabbing
a shirt-sleeved individual by the arm. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
Charlie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow looked at him wonderingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Charlie? Oh, you mean the &lsquo;Kid&rsquo;?
Well, he ain&rsquo;t here ter-night; had a weddin&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; is totin&rsquo; the bridal couple &rsquo;round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairbain swore discreetly under his breath, and cast
an uncertain glance at the slender figure shrinking
beside him. The streets of Sheridan were not over
pleasant at night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only hack in town is somewhere else, Miss,&rdquo;
he explained briefly. &ldquo;I reckon you and I will
have to hoof it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt the grip of her fingers on his sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boys are a little noisy, but it&rsquo;s
just their way--don&rsquo;t mean anything--you hang
on to me, an&rsquo; keep the veil down--we &rsquo;ll
be there in the shake of a dog&rsquo;s tail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He helped her over the muddy crossing, and as they
reached a stretch of board walk, began expatiating
on the various places lining the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Mammoth&rsquo; over
there,--dance hall back of it--biggest thing west
of the Missouri--three men killed there last week--what
for? Oh, they got too fresh--that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;Casino,&rsquo;
and the one beyond is &rsquo;Pony Joe&rsquo;s Place&rsquo;--cut
his leg off since I&rsquo;ve been here--fight over
a girl. Ain&rsquo;t there any stores?--sure; they&rsquo;re
farther back--you see the saloons got in first--that&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Sheeny Mike&rsquo;s&rsquo; gambling joint you&rsquo;re
looking at--like to go over and see &rsquo;em play?
All right, just thought I&rsquo;d ask you--it&rsquo;s
early anyhow, and things wouldn&rsquo;t be goin&rsquo;
very lively yet. Say, there, you red head, what are
you trying to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow had lurched out of the crowd in such a
manner as to brush partially aside the girl&rsquo;s
veil, permitting the glare of &ldquo;Sheeny Mike&rsquo;s&rdquo;
lights to fall full upon her revealed face. It was
accomplished so openly as to appear planned, but before
he could reel away again, Fairbain struck out, and
the man went down. With an oath he was on his feet,
and Hope cowered back against her protector. Each
man had weapons drawn, the crowd scurrying madly to
keep out of the line of fire, when, with a stride,
a new figure stepped quietly in between them. Straight
as an arrow, broad shouldered, yet small waisted as
a woman, his hair hanging low over his coat-collar,
his face smooth shaven except for a long moustache,
and emotionless, the revolvers in his belt untouched,
he simply looked at the two, and then struck the revolver
out of the drunken man&rsquo;s hand. It fell harmless
to the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you pick it up until I tell
you, Scott,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;If you
do you&rsquo;ve got to fight me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without apparently giving the fellow another thought,
he wheeled and faced the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you, is it, Doctor? The drunken
fool won&rsquo;t make any more trouble. Where were
you taking the lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the hotel, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk along with you. I reckon the
boys will give us plenty of room.&rdquo; He glanced
over the crowd, and then more directly at Scott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pick up your gun!&rdquo; the brief words snapping
out. &ldquo;This is the second time I&rsquo;ve caught
you hunting trouble. The next time you are going to
find it. I saw you run into the lady--what did you
do it for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wanted to see who she was, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t call me Bill. I don&rsquo;t
trot in your class. My name is Hickock to you. Was
it any of your affair who she was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckoned I know&rsquo;d her, and I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The marshal turned his eyes toward Hope, and then
back upon Scott, evidently slightly interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So? Recognized an old friend, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The slight sneer in &ldquo;Wild Bill&rsquo;s&rdquo;
soft voice caused Scott to flame up in sudden passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t! but I called the turn just
the same--she&rsquo;s Christie Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The marshal smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, little boy,&rdquo; he said soberly.
&ldquo;Now you trot straight along to bed. Don&rsquo;t
let me catch you on the street again to-night, and
I&rsquo;d advise you not to pull another gun--you&rsquo;re
too slow on the trigger for this town. Come along,
Doctor, and we&rsquo;ll get Miss Maclaire to her hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shouldered his way through the collected crowd,
the others following. Hope endeavored to speak, to
explain to Fairbain who she actually was, realizing
then, for the first time, that she had not previously
given him her name. Amidst the incessant noise and
confusion, the blaring of brass, and the jangle of
voices, she found it impossible to make the man comprehend.
She pressed closer to him, holding more tightly to
his arm, stunned and confused by the fierce uproar.
The stranger steadily pushing ahead of them, and opening
a path for their passage, fascinated her, and her
eyes watched him curiously. His name was an oddly familiar
one, associated in vague memory with some of the most
desperate deeds ever witnessed in the West, yet always
found on the side of law and order; it was difficult
to conceive that this quiet-spoken, mild-eyed, gently
smiling man could indeed be the most famous gun fighter
on the border, hated, feared, yet thoroughly respected,
by every desperado between the Platte and the Canadian.
Beyond the glare and glitter of the Metropolitan Dance
Hall the noisy crowd thinned away somewhat, and the
marshal ventured to drop back beside Fairbain, yet
vigilantly watched every approaching face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Town appears unusually lively to-night, Bill,&rdquo;
observed the latter gravely, &ldquo;and the boys have
got an early start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;West end graders just paid off,&rdquo; was
the reply. &ldquo;They have been whoopin&rsquo; it
up ever since noon, and are beginning to get ugly.
Now the rest of the outfit are showing up, and there
will probably be something interesting happening before
morning. Wouldn&rsquo;t mind it so much if I had a
single deputy worth his salt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with Bain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, while he was on the job, but &lsquo;Red&rsquo;
Haggerty got him in &rsquo;Pony Joe&rsquo;s&rsquo;
shebang two hours ago; shot him in the back across
the bar. Ned never even pulled his gun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear that; what became of
Haggerty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The marshal let his eyes rest questioningly on the
doctor&rsquo;s face for an instant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I happened to be just behind Ned when
he went in,&rdquo; he said gently, &ldquo;and &lsquo;Red&rsquo;
will be buried on &lsquo;Boots Hill&rsquo; to-morrow.
I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t give you much chance
to show your skill, Doc,&rdquo; with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If they all shot like you do, my profession
would be useless. What&rsquo;s the matter with your
other deputies?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lack of nerve, principally, I reckon; ain&rsquo;t
one of &rsquo;em worth the powder to blow him up.
I&rsquo;d give something just now for a fellow I had
down at Dodge--he was a man. Never had to tell him
when to go in; good judgment too; wasn&rsquo;t out
hunting for trouble, but always ready enough to take
his share. Old soldier in our army, Captain I heard,
though he never talked much about himself; maybe you
knew him--Jack Keith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon,&rdquo; in quick surprise, &ldquo;and
what&rsquo;s more to the point, he&rsquo;s here--slept
in my room last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keith here? In Sheridan? And hasn&rsquo;t even
hunted me up yet? That&rsquo;s like him, all right,
but I honestly want to see the boy. Here&rsquo;s your
hotel. Shall you need me any longer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better step in with us, Bill,&rdquo; the doctor
advised, &ldquo;your moral influence might aid in
procuring the lady a decent room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon it might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed together up the three rickety steps leading
into the front hall, which latter opened directly
into the cramped office; to the left was the wide-open
barroom, clamorous and throbbing with life. A narrow
bench stood against the wall, with a couple of half
drunken men lounging upon it. The marshal routed them
out with a single, expressive gesture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait here with the lady, Fairbain,&rdquo; he
said shortly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll arrange for the
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They watched him glance in at the bar, vigilant and
cautious, and then move directly across to the desk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; he said genially to the clerk.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just escorted a lady here from the
train--Miss Maclaire--and want you to give her the
very best room in your old shebang.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other looked at him doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hell, Bill, I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to do that,&rdquo; acknowledged. &ldquo;She
wrote in here to the boss for a room; said she&rsquo;d
be along yesterday. Well, she didn&rsquo;t show up,
an&rsquo; so to-night we let a fellow have it. He&rsquo;s
up there now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll have to vamose--who is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Englishman--&rsquo;Walter Spotteswood Montgomery,&rsquo;&rdquo;
consulting his book. &ldquo;Hell of a pompous duck;
the boys call him &lsquo;Juke Montgomery.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right; send some one up to rout his lordship
out lively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tommy shuffled his feet, and looked again at the marshal;
he had received positive orders about that room, and
was fully convinced that Montgomery would not take
kindly to eviction. But Hickock&rsquo;s quiet gray
eyes were insistent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, &lsquo;Red,&rsquo;&rdquo; he finally
called to the burly porter, &ldquo;hustle up to &lsquo;15,&rsquo;
an&rsquo; tell that fellow Montgomery he&rsquo;s got
to get out; tell him we want the room for a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hickock watched the man disappear up the stairs, helped
himself carefully to a cigar out of the stand, tossing
a coin to the clerk and then deliberately lighting
up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think Montgomery will be pleased?&rdquo; he
asked shortly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;ll probably throw &lsquo;Red&rsquo;
down stairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The marshal smiled, his glance turning expectantly
in that direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps I had better remain, Tommy.&rdquo;
And he strolled nonchalantly over to the open window,
and stood there looking quietly out, a spiral of blue
smoke rising from his cigar.</p>

<p>They could distinctly hear the pounding on the door
above, and occasionally the sound of the porter&rsquo;s
voice, but the straight, erect figure at the window
remained motionless. Finally &ldquo;Red&rdquo; came
down, nursing his knuckles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Says he&rsquo;ll be damned if he will--says
he&rsquo;s gone to bed, an&rsquo; that there ain&rsquo;t
a cussed female in this blasted country he&rsquo;d
git up for,&rdquo; he reported circumstantially to
the clerk. &ldquo;He told me to tell you to go plumb
to hell, an&rsquo; that if any one else come poundin&rsquo;
&rsquo;round thar to-night, he&rsquo;d take a pot
shot at &rsquo;em through the door. &lsquo;Fifteen&rsquo;
seemed a bit peevish, sir, an&rsquo; I reckoned if
he was riled up much more, he might git rambunctious;
his language was sure fierce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wild Bill&rdquo; turned slowly around, still
calmly smoking, his eyes exhibiting mild amusement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you clearly inform Mr.--ah--Montgomery
that we desired the room for the use of a lady?&rdquo;
he questioned gently, apparently both pained and shocked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It surprises me to find one in our city with
so little regard for the ordinary courtesies of life,
Tommy. Perhaps I can persuade the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He disappeared up the stairs, taking them deliberately
step by step, the cigar still smoking between his
lips. &ldquo;Red&rdquo; called after him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep away from in front of the door, Bill;
he&rsquo;ll shoot sure, for he cocked his gun when
I was up there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hickock glanced back, and waved his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry--the room occupied by Mr.--ah--Montgomery
was &lsquo;15,&rsquo; I believe you said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whatever occurred above, it was over with very shortly.
Those listening at the foot of the stairs heard the
first gentle rap on the door, an outburst of profanity,
followed almost instantly by a sharp snap, as if a
lock had given way, then brief scuffling mingled with
the loud creaking of a bed. Scarcely a minute later
the marshal appeared on the landing above, one hand
firmly gripped in the neck-band of an undershirt, thus
securely holding the writhing, helpless figure of
a man, who swore violently every time he could catch
his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any other room you could conveniently assign
Mr.--ah--Montgomery to, Tommy?&rdquo; he asked pleasantly.
&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t like it in the morning,
he could be changed, you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give--give him &lsquo;47.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;m the bell-boy temporarily,
Montgomery; easy now, my man, easy, or I&rsquo;ll
be compelled to use both hands. &lsquo;Red,&rsquo;
carry the gentleman&rsquo;s luggage to &rsquo;47&rsquo;--he
has kindly consented to give up his old room to a
lady--come along, Montgomery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was possibly five minutes later when he came down,
still smoking, his face not even flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Montgomery is feeling so badly we were obliged
to lock him in,&rdquo; he reported to the clerk. &ldquo;Seems
to be of a somewhat nervous disposition. Well, good-night,
Doctor,&rdquo; he lifted his hat. &ldquo;And to you,
Miss, pleasant dreams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hope watched him as he stepped outside, pausing a
moment in the shadows to glance keenly up and down
the long street before venturing down the steps. This
quiet man had enemies, hundreds of them, desperate
and reckless; ceaseless vigilance alone protected
him. Yet her eyes only, and not her thoughts, were
riveted on the disappearing marshal. She turned to
Fairbain, who had risen to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I might see him, also,&rdquo; she said,
as though continuing an interrupted conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See him? Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keith. I--I knew him once, and--and, Doctor,
won&rsquo;t you tell him I should like to have him
come and see me just--just as soon as he can.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>An Interrupted Interview</h2>

<p>Miss Christie Maclaire, attired in a soft lounging
robe, her luxuriant hair wound simply about her head,
forming a decidedly attractive picture, gazed with
manifest dissatisfaction on the bare walls of her room,
and then out through the open window into the comparatively
quiet street below. The bar-tender at the &ldquo;Palace,&rdquo;
directly opposite, business being slack, was leaning
negligently in the doorway. His roving eyes caught
the fair face framed in the window, and he waved his
hand encouragingly. Miss Christie&rsquo;s big brown
eyes stared across at him in silent disgust, and then
wandered again about the room, her foot tapping nervously
on the rag carpet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my very last trip to this town,&rdquo;
she said decisively, her red lips pressed tightly
together.</p>

<p>Miss Maclaire had indeed ample reason to feel aggrieved
over her reception. She had written to have the best
apartment in the house reserved for her, and then,
merely because she had later been invited out to Fort
Hays, and was consequently a day behind in arrival,
had discovered that another woman--a base imposter,
actually masquerading under her name --had been duly
installed in the coveted apartment. Driving in from
the fort that morning, accompanied by two of the more
susceptible junior officers, conscious that she had
performed most artistic work the evening before in
the spacious mess-hall, and feeling confident of comfortable
quarters awaiting her, it had been something of a shock
to be informed by the perturbed clerk that &ldquo;15&rdquo;
was already occupied by another. &ldquo;A lady what
come in last night, and I naturally supposed it was
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In vain Miss Maclaire protested, ably backed by the
worshipful officers who still gallantly attended her;
the management was obdurate. Then she would go up
herself, and throw the hussy out. Indeed, too angry
for bantering further words, Christie had actually
started for the stairs, intending to execute her threat,
when the perspiring Tommy succeeded in stopping her,
by plainly blurting out the exact truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever do it,&rdquo; he insisted.
&ldquo;The marshal brought her in here, and fired
a fellow out o&rsquo; the room so as to give it to
her. He&rsquo;d clean out this house if we ran in
a cold deck on a friend o&rsquo; his.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do I care for what your marshal does?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s Bill Hickock, Miss, &lsquo;Wild
Bill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Maclaire leaned back against the stair-rail,
her eyes turning from Tommy to her speechless supporters.
Slowly the truth seemed to penetrate her brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she gasped at last. &ldquo;Then--then
what else can you give me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officers had long since departed, promising, however,
to remain over in town and hear her again that night
at the Trocadero, with hints as to a late supper;
she had received a call from the manager of that most
popular resort, and had rendered his life miserable
by numerous demands; had passed half an hour practising
with the leader of the orchestra; but now was at last
alone, tired, decidedly irritable, and still tempted
to invade &ldquo;15,&rdquo; and give that other woman
a piece of her mind. Then someone rapped on the door.
There was a decided accent of vexation in the voice
which bade the one outside enter, but the lady&rsquo;s
mood changed swiftly as her brown eyes perceived standing
in the doorway the erect form of Keith, the light
from the window revealing clearly his strong face.
The man stood hat in hand, bowing slightly, unable
to comprehend why he should have been sent for, yet
marvelling again at the remarkable resemblance between
this woman and that other whom he had left at Fort
Larned. As Miss Maclaire stood with back toward the
window, she presented the same youthful appearance,
the same slenderness of figure, the same contour of
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Christie Maclaire?&rdquo; he asked, as
though in doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; graciously, won instantly by the
man&rsquo;s appearance and manner, &ldquo;you wished
to see me? Will you be seated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He crossed the narrow room to the stiff-backed chair
indicated, and the lady sank negligently down into
her own, resting her head against a pillow, and regarding
him expectantly. He could view her now much more distinctly,
observing the slight difference in age, the fuller
lips, the darker shade of the hair, and the varied
expression of the eyes. It was as if a different soul
looked forth from the same face. He had never before
realized how little, apparently trifling, details marked
the human countenance, and, embarrassed by her own
scrutiny, his glance swept about the room. Misunderstanding
this shifting of eyes, Miss Christie sought to place
the man more at ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The room is a perfect fright,&rdquo; she observed
briskly, &ldquo;but what can one expect in these mushroom
towns? Really I had never been here before, or I shouldn&rsquo;t
have come. They pay good money though for talent, and
we all have to live, you know. Are--are you in professional
work?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head, smiling, somewhat perplexed at
his reception.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really I didn&rsquo;t suppose you were,&rdquo;
she went on, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t look it. But there
are so many who come to me to help them, that I have
grown suspicious of every stranger. May I ask why
you desired to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another suspicion had taken possession of her mind,
for the men of that section were never backward in
exhibiting admiration, yet somehow this man did not
seem exactly of that kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came merely because I was sent for, Miss
Maclaire,&rdquo; he replied, his gray eyes once again
upon her face. &ldquo;Doctor Fairbain gave me your
message; I am Jack Keith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked the complete astonishment she felt, sitting
up in the chair, her eyes filled with questioning
doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Fairbain! My message! Surely you are
mistaken? I know no one of that name, and have sent
no message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not express a desire to see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed, exhibiting a row of white teeth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not; not until this moment was I
even of the existence of Mr. Jack Keith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His own eyes smiled in response to the challenge of
hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can assure you the surprise was mine also,&rdquo;
he hastened to inform her, now more at ease, as he
grasped the situation. &ldquo;I could not understand
how I had become known to you, yet I pledge you my
word the message was actually brought. Of course you
may suspicion otherwise, for I have seen you on the
stage, and being a normal man, have wished that I could
devise some excuse for meeting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; her eye-brows slightly uplifted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I make that confession frankly, yet this
call comes from no such desire. I had no question
when I came, but what I had been sent for--you will
believe this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must, yet it seems very peculiar,&rdquo;
she replied, feeling convinced that he was a gentleman,
and troubled as to what she had best do. &ldquo;Yet
now that you have discovered your mistake--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope to take advantage of the opportunity,&rdquo;
he broke in firmly, leaning slightly forward. &ldquo;May
I ask you a question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could hardly prevent it, and really I do
not know that I have anything to conceal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will risk the effort--do you know a
man named Hawley?--Bartlett Hawley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes did not falter, although a red spot shot
into her cheeks, and her lips pressed together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; that is I have never met him,&rdquo; she
acknowledged, just a trifle confused. &ldquo;But I
have received two letters signed by that name, and
rather expected the gentleman would call upon me here
in Sheridan during my engagement. Is that your mission?
Were you sent by him? or are you Mr. Hawley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I disclaim all relation, Miss Maclaire, even
friendship. You, of course, know who this individual
is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the short monosyllable was not encouraging.
&ldquo;His messages were of a business character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I presumed, yet one likes to know something
even of the person he does business with. I have been
acquainted with Hawley for several years, and have
never been aware of any honorable business he has ever
engaged in. He is a professional gambler, known on
the frontier as &lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo;; last night
he was running a faro game across there in the &lsquo;Palace.&rsquo;
I cannot help wondering what kind of business such
a fellow could possibly have with you, Miss Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman&rsquo;s eyes flashed, hardening in their
brown depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What right have you to ask?&rdquo; she began
indigently. &ldquo;I am capable of deciding my own
affairs. As I have told you I have never met Mr. Hawley,
but I am not to be influenced against him merely by
the denunciation of an avowed enemy. He has written
me of something he has discovered which is of deep
personal interest to me, and has promised to tell me
the details, as well as place within my hands certain
necessary papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your feelings,&rdquo; he said
gently, as she paused, &ldquo;but would you mind telling
me the nature of those papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something in Keith&rsquo;s face which told
of honesty, and inspired confidence. Miss Maclaire&rsquo;s
worldly experience had given her deep insight into
the character of men, and somehow, as she looked into
the clear gray eyes, she felt impelled to answer,
a vague doubt of the unknown Hawley in her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They--they were papers to establish identity.
He had discovered them by accident; they have to do
with an inheritance. Really that is all I know, for
he wrote very briefly, stating it would be safer to
confer with me personally--only I imagine there is
a large sum involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From whose estate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My grandfather&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his name was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why--why, Mr. Keith, actually I do not know.
It may seem strange, but-- but I cannot even tell
the names of my parents; I cannot remember either
my father or mother. Oh, I do not know why I should
tell you all this! Who are you, really? Why do you
ask me such questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned forward, touched by the woman&rsquo;s emotion.
 &ldquo;Miss Maclaire,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;I
am not prying into your life needlessly, but am endeavoring
to serve you as well as others. Hawley may indeed possess
papers of great value, but if so they were not found
by accident, but stolen from the body of a murdered
man. These papers may possibly refer to you, but if
so Hawley himself does not believe it--he has simply
chosen you to impersonate the right party because
of physical resemblance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Resemblance to whom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To a young woman, a Miss Hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how do you know this? Why should you be
interested? Are you a detective?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I am not a detective, but I cannot explain
to you my interest. I am trying to serve you, to keep
you from being drawn into a plot--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather to keep me from learning the truth,
Mr. Jack Keith,&rdquo; she burst forth, rising to
her feet indignantly. &ldquo;You are here trying to
prejudice me against Mr. Hawley. He is your enemy,
and you have come to me stabbing him in the back for
revenge. That is your interest. Well, I am going to
see the man, and consider what he has to say. I don&rsquo;t
care half so much about the money as I do to find
out who I am. If he can throw any light on my early
life, on my parentage, I shall be the happiest woman
in the world. I am sorry I told you anything--but
I am going to see him just the same. Perhaps he might
tell me something about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were both standing, the woman&rsquo;s eyes flashing
angrily, defiantly, her hands clinched. Keith, realizing
the false position into which he had drifted, hesitated
to answer. He meant to tell her the whole story and
urge her to cooperate with him in learning the gambler&rsquo;s
purpose. The woman impressed him as honest at heart,
in spite of her life and environment; she was not
one whom a swindler could easily dupe into becoming
a tool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Maclaire,&rdquo; he began, determined
on his course, &ldquo;listen to me for just a moment.
I am--&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a rap at the door. The eyes of both turned
that way, and then Keith backed slowly into the darkened
corner beyond the window, his right hand thrust into
the pocket of his coat. Miss Maclaire observed the
movement, her lips smiling, a red flush on either cheek.
Then she stepped across the root, and opened the door.
Framed against the black background of the hall, his
dark, rather handsome face clearly revealed as he fronted
the window, his black, audacious eyes fixed appreciatingly
upon the lady, stood &ldquo;Black Bart&rdquo; Hawley.
He saw no one but her, realized no other presence,
had no thought except to make a good impression. He
was facing a beautiful woman, whom he sought to use,
and he bowed low, hat in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Maclaire,&rdquo; he said, pleasantly,
&ldquo;I trust you will pardon all that has occurred
between us, and permit me to explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I--I do not understand,&rdquo; she replied,
puzzled by these unexpected words. &ldquo;There has
nothing occurred between us, I am sure, which requires
explanation. Have we met before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man smiled. Seeing the woman&rsquo;s face in the
shadows he was still convinced she was the same he
had last parted with on the Salt Fork. However, if
she preferred to ignore all that, and begin their relations
anew, it was greatly to his liking. It gave him insight
into her character, and fresh confidence that he could
gain her assistance. Anyhow, he was ready enough to
play her game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us assume not,&rdquo; just the slightest
trace of mockery in the tone, &ldquo;and begin anew.
At least, you will confess the receipt of my letters--I
am Bartlett Hawley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She cast a half-frightened glance toward Keith, and
the man, following the direction of her eyes, perceived
the presence of the other. His right leg went backward,
his hand dropping to the belt, his form stiffening
erect. Keith&rsquo;s voice, low but clear in the silence,
seemed to cut the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a motion, Hawley! I have you covered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, gentlemen, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have no fear, Miss Maclaire; this man and I
will settle our differences elsewhere, and not in
your presence.&rdquo; He stepped forth into the middle
of the room, revolver drawn, but held low at the hip,
his watchful eyes never deserting the gambler&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Back up against the wall, Hawley,&rdquo; he
commanded. &ldquo;I hardly need to tell you how I
shoot, for we, at least, have met before. Now, I&rsquo;m
going out, and leave you to your interview with Miss
Maclaire, and I wish you happiness and success.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He moved across to the opening, keeping his face toward
his adversary; then backed out slowly, closed the
door with a snap, and sprang aside to avoid any possibility
of a bullet crashing after him. No sound of movement
from within reached his ears, however, and he walked
silently to the head of the stairs.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXIII"></a>Chapter XXIII</h1>

<h2>An Unexpected Meeting</h2>

<p>Keith paused at the landing, looking down into the
deserted office, almost tempted to return and force
Hawley into a confession of his purpose. It was easy
for him to conceive what would be the final result
of this interview between the artistic gambler and
Miss Maclaire. In spite of the vague suspicion of
evil which the plainsman had implanted within the
woman&rsquo;s mind, the other possessed the advantage,
and would certainly improve it. All conditions were
decidedly in his favor. He merely needed to convince
the girl that she was actually the party sought, and
she would go forward, playing the game he desired,
believing herself right, totally unconscious of any
fraud. The very simplicity of it rendered the plot
the more dangerous, the more difficult to expose.
Hawley had surely been favored by fortune in discovering
this singer who chanced to resemble Hope so remarkably,
and who, at the same time, was in such ignorance as
to her own parentage. She would be ready to grasp
at a straw, and, once persuaded as to her identity
and legal rights, could henceforth be trusted implicitly
as an ally.</p>

<p>Realizing all this, and comprehending also how easily
Hawley would win her confidence and overcome his warning
by denouncing him as a fugitive from justice charged
with murder, the temptation to return and fight it
out then and there became almost overpowering. He
had no fear of Hawley; indeed, physical fear had scarcely
a place in his composition, but he was not as yet
sufficiently fortified with facts for the seeking of
such an encounter. He could merely guess at the truth,
unable to produce any proof with which to meet the
gambler&rsquo;s certain denial.</p>

<p>A man came in through the office, and began climbing
the stairs. He was almost at the landing before Keith
recognized him or the other glanced up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah--seen her, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Keith, not thinking it
worth while to mention the lady&rsquo;s denial of
having sent for him, &ldquo;I have just come from there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum--thought you&rsquo;d be through by this
time--fine looking girl, ain&rsquo;t she?--believe
I&rsquo;ll run in and chat with her myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would advise you to select some other time,
Doctor,&rdquo; said the younger, drily, &ldquo;as
the lady has a visitor at present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A visitor?&rdquo; his face rosy, his shrewd
eyes darkening. &ldquo;Ah, indeed! Of the male sex?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I judge so--&rsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; Hawley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; so startled his voice broke.
&ldquo;Did he see you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather; I backed him up against the wall with
a gun while I made my adieu.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what brought him there? Are they acquainted?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask conundrums, Doctor. He may
be your rival with the fair lady for all I know. If
he is, my sympathies are all with you. Only I wouldn&rsquo;t
try to see Miss Christie just now; I&rsquo;d wait
for a clearer field. Hawley is probably not in the
best of humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairbain stared into the face of the speaker, uncertain
whether or not he was being laughed at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reckon you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he acknowledged
at last. &ldquo;Tired, anyhow--been out all night--thought
I&rsquo;d like to see her again, though--finest looking
woman I&rsquo;ve met since I came West--remarkable
eyes--well, I&rsquo;ll go along to bed-- see you again
to-morrow, Jack.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith watched the sturdy figure stomp heavily down
the hall-way, loose boards creaking under his positive
tread, and smiled to himself at the thought that he
might have, indeed, become truly interested in the
music hall singer. Somehow, the doctor did not harmonize
with the conception of love, or fit graciously into
the picture. Still, stranger matings had occurred,
and Cupid does not ask permission before he plays pranks
with hearts. Keith turned again toward the stairs,
only to observe a woman slowly cross the office and
commence the ascent. She was in the shadow, her face
even more deeply shaded by her hat, yet he stared at
her in amazement--surely, it was Miss Maclaire! Yet
how could it be? He had left that person scarcely
five minutes before in &ldquo;26,&rdquo; and this stairway
was the only exit. His hand grasped the rail, his
heart throbbing strangely, as a suspicion of the truth
crossed his brain. Could this be Hope? Could it be
that she was here also? As her foot touched the landing,
she saw him, her eyes lighting up suddenly in recognition,
a wave of color flooding her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Captain Keith,&rdquo; she exclaimed, extending
her gloved hand frankly, &ldquo;you have been to my
room, and were going away. I am so glad I came in
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly thought to meet you,&rdquo; he replied,
retaining her fingers in his grasp. &ldquo;When did
you reach Sheridan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only last night. I had no idea you were here,
until Doctor Fairbain chanced to mention your name.
Then I at once begged him to tell you how exceedingly
anxious I was to see you. You see, I was sure you would
come if you only knew. I really thought you would
be here this morning, and remained in my room waiting,
but there were some things I actually had to have.
I wasn&rsquo;t out ten minutes, so you mustn&rsquo;t
think I sent you a message and then forgot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nature of the mistake was becoming apparent, and
Keith&rsquo;s gray eyes smiled as they looked into
the depths of the brown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your message had rather an amusing result,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;as the doctor informed me that Miss
Christie Maclaire was the one who desired my presence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Maclaire!&rdquo; her voice exhibiting
startled surprise. &ldquo;Why--why--oh, I did forget;
I never told him differently. Why, it was most ridiculous.&rdquo;
She laughed, white teeth gleaming between the parted
red lips, yet not altogether happily. &ldquo;Let me
explain, Captain Keith, for really I have not been
masquerading. Doctor Fairbain and I arrived upon the
same train last evening. He is such a funny man, but
was very nice, and offered to escort me to the hotel.
I remember now that although he introduced himself,
I never once thought to mention to him my name. The
town was very rough last night--the company had paid
off the graders I was told--and there was no carriage,
so we were compelled to walk. I--I never saw such a
mob of drunken men. One came reeling against me, and
brushed aside my veil so as to see my face. The doctor
struck him, and then the marshal came up--you know
him, Bill Hickock--and the impudent fellow actually
declared he knew me, that I was Christie Maclaire.
I tried to explain, but they hurried me on through
the crowd to the hotel, and I became confused, and
forgot. Do you suppose they registered me by that
name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite likely; at least Fairbain still believes
it was the fair Christie whom he so gallantly escorted
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How provoking,&rdquo; her foot tapping the
floor, a little wrinkle between her eyes. &ldquo;It
seems as though I couldn&rsquo;t escape that woman--does
she--does she really look like me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At a little distance, yes,&rdquo; he admitted,
&ldquo;her form and face resemble yours very closely,
but her hair is darker, her eyes have a different
expression, and she must be five or six years older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do--do you know her well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; I have seen her several times on
the stage, but never met her until a few moments ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few moments ago! Do you mean she is here
in this hotel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Hope, and that was what made the
mistake in names so laughable. Fairbain gave me your
message, but as coming from Christie. I was, of course,
greatly surprised, yet responded. The lady very promptly
denied having sent for me, but as I was anxious to
interview her myself, we managed to drift into conversation,
and I must have passed a half hour there. I might
have been there still, but for an interruption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; with rising inflection.</p>

<p>He glanced quickly about, reminded of the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hawley came in, and I would prefer not
to meet him here, or have him discover you were in
Sheridan. Could we not go to your room? I have much
to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her questioning eyes left his face, and stared down
over the rail. A heavily built man, with red moustache,
leaned against the clerk&rsquo;s desk, his face toward
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know that man?&rdquo; she asked quickly.
&ldquo;He followed me all the time I was shopping.
I--I believe he is the same one who jostled me in the
crowd last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith leaned past her to get a better view, but the
fellow turned, and slouched away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only had a glimpse, but have no recollection
of ever seeing him before. You heard no name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wild Bill&rsquo; called him either Scott,
or Scotty--if this is the same man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith&rsquo;s jaw set, the fighting light burning
in his eyes. That was the name of the fellow rooming
with Willoughby, the one who seemed to be Hawley&rsquo;s
special assistant. Was he here as a spy? His hands
clinched on the rail. He was anxious to go down and
wring the truth out of him, but instead, he compelled
his eyes to smile, turning back to the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A mere accident probably; but about my request?
May I talk with you a few moments alone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bowed, apparently still dissatisfied regarding
his lengthy conversation with Christie, yet permitted
him to follow down the hall. She held open the door
of &ldquo;15,&rdquo; and he entered silently, not wholly
understanding the change in her manner. She stood before
the dresser, drawing off her gloves and removing her
hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be seated, Captain; the arm-chair
by the window is the more comfortable.&rdquo; She
turned toward him, almost shyly, yet with womanly
curiosity which would not be stilled. &ldquo;Was your
call upon Miss Maclaire very interesting? Did you
admire her very much?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith&rsquo;s eyes lifted to her face, his ears quick
to detect the undertone in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Interesting? yes, for I was seeking after information,
and met with some success. As to the other question,
I am not sure whether I admire the lady or not. She
is bright, pretty, and companionable, and in spite
of her profession, at heart, I believe, a good woman.
But really, Miss Hope, I was too deeply immersed in
my purpose to give her personality much consideration.
Among other things we spoke of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of me? Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told her something of our adventures together;
of how both Hawley and I had been confused. She was
anxious to learn who you were, but unfortunately,
I have never, even yet, heard your name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; I left you at Fort Larned believing you
Christie Maclaire--supposing it your stage name, of
course--and was confirmed in this belief by finding
in the holster of the saddle you had been riding an
envelope bearing that address.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember; it contained the note the man brought
to me from Hawley; he had written it that way.&rdquo;
She crossed the room, sinking down into a chair facing
him. &ldquo;And you have actually confused me with
Christie Maclaire all this while? Have never known
who I was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you to call me Hope; that is my name--I
am Hope Waite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waite!&rdquo; he leaned forward, startled by
the possibility--&ldquo;not--not--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she burst in, holding out her hands,
clasping the locket, &ldquo;and this was my father&rsquo;s;
where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the trinket from her, turning it over in his
fingers. Little by little the threads of mystery were
being unravelled, yet, even now, he could not see
very far. He looked up from the locket into her questioning
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you? No; then it was an oversight.
This was about the throat of one of the men I buried
at Cimmaron Crossing, but--but, Hope, it was not your
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; her voice choking slightly.
&ldquo;Mrs. Murphy found that out; that is why I am
here. I heard my father came to Sheridan, and I wanted
you to help me find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was thinking, and did not answer at once, and she
went on in some alarm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about him, Captain Keith?
Where is he? Why is he here? Don&rsquo;t be afraid
to tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He pressed the locket back into her hand, retaining
the latter, unresisted, within his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not seen your father, Hope, but he was
certainly here a few days ago, for Fairbain met him.
They were together in the army. I am going to tell
you all I know--it seems to be a tangled web, but the
ends must be somewhere, although, I confess, I am
all at sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told it slowly and simply, bringing forth his earlier
suspicion, and how he had stumbled upon facts apparently
confirming them. He related her father&rsquo;s robbery,
his loss of valuable papers, and the conversation
between Hawley and Scott which led to the suspicion
that these same papers had fallen into the hands of
the former, and were the basis of his plot. Hope listened,
breathless with interest, her widely opened eyes filled
with wonder. As he concluded speaking she burst forth:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand in the least,
Captain Keith. Why did this man Hawley send me to
the Salt Fork?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thought he was dealing with Christie Maclaire.
He had some reason for getting her away; getting her
where he could exercise influence over her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes--yes; but who is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is what makes the matter so hard to unravel.
She doesn&rsquo;t even know herself. Hawley is going
to take advantage of her ignorance in this respect,
and convince her that she is the person he wishes her
to represent--but who is the person? If we knew that
we might block the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both sat silent, striving to figure out some reasonable
explanation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know of any special papers your father
carried?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; none outside his business agreements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has anyone ever disappeared connected with
your family? Did you have an older sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fred and I were the only children. Why should
you ask that question?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because something of that nature would seem
to be the only rational explanation. Your brother
must have told Hawley something--some family secret--which
he felt could be utilized to his own advantage. Then
he saw your picture, and was immediately reminded
of the remarkable resemblance between you and Christie
Maclaire. Evidently this discovery fitted into his
plan, and made it possible for him to proceed. He has
been trying ever since to get an interview with the
woman, to sound her, and find out what he can do with
her. He has written letters, sufficiently explicit
to make it clear his scheme is based upon a will drawn,
as he claims, by Christie&rsquo;s grandfather. No
doubt by this time he has fully convinced the girl
that she is the rightful heiress to property--as he
stated to Scott-- valued at over a million dollars.
That&rsquo;s a stake worth fighting for, and these
two will make a hard combination. He&rsquo;s got the
papers, or claims to have, and they must be the ones
stolen from your father. I have been trusting you
might know something in your family history which would
make it all plain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I do not,&rdquo; decisively. &ldquo;You
must believe me; not so much as a hint of any secret
has ever reached me. There are only the four of us,
Father, Mother, Fred, and I. I am sure there can be
no secret; nothing which I would not know. Perhaps,
if I could see Miss Maclaire--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am convinced that would be useless,&rdquo;
he interrupted, rising, and pacing across the floor.
&ldquo;If Hawley has convinced her of the justice of
the claim, he will also have pledged her to secrecy.
He is working out of sight like a mole, for he knows
the fraud, and will never come to the surface until
everything is in readiness. I know a better way; I&rsquo;ll
find Fred, and bring him here. He would tell you whatever
it was he told Hawley, and that will give us the clue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He picked up his hat from the table, but she rose
to her feet, holding forth her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot thank you enough. Captain Keith,&rdquo;
she exclaimed frankly. &ldquo;You are doing so much,
and with no personal interest--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The long lashes dropped over the brown eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I have a personal interest--in you, Hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood silent, her bosom rising and falling to
rapid breathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my calling you Hope? I
haven&rsquo;t got used to Miss Waite yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes met his swiftly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, not. Such ceremony would be foolish
after all you have done for me. Do--do you call her
Christie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, clasping her hands closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you no--she is strictly Miss Maclaire,
and,&rdquo; solemnly, &ldquo;shall be to the end of
the chapter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I didn&rsquo;t care, only that was
what you called her when you were telling me what
she said. Are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, to find Fred; the sooner we can get this
straightened out, the better.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXIV"></a>Chapter XXIV</h1>

<h2>A Mistake in Assassination</h2>

<p>Let his future be what it might, Jack Keith would
never again forget the girl who held the door open
for his passage with one hand, her other clasped in
his. Interested before, yet forcing himself into indifference
now that he knew who she really was, the man made full
surrender. It was a struggle that kept him from clasping
the slender figure in his arms, and pouring forth
the words of tenderness which he sternly choked back.
This was neither the time, nor the place, yet his
eyes must have spoken, for Hope&rsquo;s glance fell,
and her cheeks grew crimson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not need to pledge you to return this
time, do I?&rdquo; she questioned, her voice trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;nor any time
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hall was deserted, but a few men loitered in the
office. Keith recognized none of the faces, and did
not stop to make any inquiries of the clerk. It was
growing dark, the lights already burning, and from
the plashing of drops on the window, it must be raining
outside. Hawley would surely have ended his call upon
Miss Maclaire long before this, and left the hotel.
However interesting his communication might have proven,
she must fill her evening engagement at the Trocadero,
and would require time for supper and rest. As to
the result of that interview there could be little
doubt. Providing the gambler possessed the proper papers
he would have small difficulty in convincing the girl
that she was indeed the one sought. Keith had probed
sufficiently into her mind to feel assured that her
inclination was to side with Hawley. Under all the
circumstances this was natural enough, and he did
not blame her.</p>

<p>He glanced into the bar-room as he passed, not in
any anticipation, but merely from the vigilance which
becomes second nature upon the frontier. Hawley stood
leaning against the bar, where he could see anyone
passing through the hall. The eyes of the two men
met, but the gambler never moved, never changed his
attitude, although Keith noted that his right hand
was hidden beneath the skirts of his long coat. The
plainsman drew back, facing his enemy, until he reached
the outer door. There was a sneer on Hawley&rsquo;s
dark sinister face like an invitation, but a memory
of the girl he had just left, and her dependence upon
him, caused Keith to avoid an encounter. He would
fight this affair out in a different way. As the door
opened and he slipped forth into the gloom, he brushed
against a man apparently just entering. The gleam
of light fell for an instant upon the face of the
other--it was Scotty with the red moustache.</p>

<p>They had been watching for him then--what for? Hawley
on the inside, and this man Scott without, were waiting
to determine when he left the hotel; would probably
dog his footsteps to discover where he went. Keith
loosened his revolver, so as to be assured he could
draw quickly, and slipped back into the shadow of
the steps, his eyes on the door of the hotel. There
was a cold, drizzly rain falling, the streets almost
deserted, appearing sodden and miserable where the
lights shone forth through saloon windows. One or
two men, seeking supper, coat collars turned up and
hats drawn low over their eyes, climbed the rickety
steps and went in, but no one came out. Perhaps he
was mistaken as to the purpose of those fellows; they
may have desired merely to know when he left, or Scott&rsquo;s
return just at that moment might have been an accident.
To be sure, the hotel possessed a back exit, but he
could not cover both ends of the building, and must
take his chances. It was too wet and disagreeable
to remain crouched there, now that it was evident
there was no intention of following him. With hand
on the butt of his gun, suspicious and watchful, yet
with scarcely a faster beat to his heart, Keith straightened
up, and began splashing his way through the mud down
the street. He knew where Willoughby would be most
likely found at this hour--with cronies at the &ldquo;Tenderfoot&rdquo;--and
he meant to discover the boy, and make him confess
to Hope the truth. Matters had now reached a point
where longer delay was dangerous.</p>

<p>Sheridan was seemingly dead, the long street silent,
gloomy, black, except for those streams of saloon
light shining across pools of water. He stumbled over
the irregular ground, occasionally striking patches
of wooden sidewalk or a strip of cinders. Here and
there a tent flapped in the wind, which drove the
drizzle into his face; somewhere ahead a swinging
sign moaned as if in agony. A few wanderers ploughed
through the muck, dim uncertain shapes appearing and
vanishing in the gloom. He had gone a block and over,
the struggle against the elements leaving him forgetful
of all else, when a man reeled out of some dimly lit
shack to his right, and staggered drunkenly forward
a few feet in advance. He could barely distinguish
the fellow&rsquo;s outlines, giving little thought
to the occurrence, for the way was unusually black
along there, the saloon opposite having shades drawn.
Suddenly a flash of red fire spurted into the night,
with a sharp report. It was so close at hand it blinded
him, and he flung up one arm over his eyes, and yet,
in that single instant, he perceived the whole picture
as revealed by the red flame. He saw the man in front
go down in a heap, the projection of the building from
behind which the shot came, the end of a wagon sticking
forth into the street which had concealed the assassin.
The blinding flash, the shock of that sudden discharge,
for a moment held him motionless; then he leaped forward,
revolver in hand, sprang around the end of the wagon,
and rushed down the dark alley between two buildings.
He could see nothing, but someone was running recklessly
ahead of him, and he fired in the direction of the
sound, the leaping spurt of flame yielding a dim outline
of the fugitive. Three times he pressed the trigger;
then there was nothing to shoot at--the fellow had
faded away into the black void of prairie. Keith stood
there baffled, staring about into the gloom, the smoking
revolver in his hand. The sound of men&rsquo;s voices
behind was all that reached him, and feeling the uselessness
of further pursuit, he retraced his way back through
the narrow passage.</p>

<p>A group was gathered about the body in the rain, a
single lantern glimmering. Two or three men had started
down the passageway, and Keith met them, revolvers
drawn and suspicious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; snapped one sharply. &ldquo;Were
you doing all that shooting yonder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith recognized the voice, thankful that he did so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fired at the fellow, but he got away onto
the prairie. I reckon you couldn&rsquo;t have done
any better, Bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack Keith!&rdquo; and Hickock&rsquo;s voice
had a new tone, his hand dropping on the other&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;Never was gladder to meet a fellow
in my life. Boys, this is an old deputy of mine down
in Dodge. When he gives up chasin&rsquo; a murderer
there isn&rsquo;t much use our tryin&rsquo;. Let&rsquo;s
go back, and find out how bad the fellow is hurt.
While we&rsquo;re feelin&rsquo; our way, Jack, you
might tell us what you know about this affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just the flash of a gun, and the man
dropped,&rdquo; Keith explained, briefly. &ldquo;I
was ten or a dozen feet behind, and the fellow fired
from under the wagon there. He must have been laying
for some one--I reckon, maybe, it was me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? Then it&rsquo;s likely you have some notion
who he was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if I have, Bill,&rdquo; and Keith&rsquo;s
lips were set tight, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not liable to
tell you. If it&rsquo;s the lad I think likely, I&rsquo;ll
attend to the case myself. You understand--this is
my personal affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hickock nodded, his hand again pressing the other&rsquo;s
shoulder</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, Jack, if you feel that way. There&rsquo;s
enough : in Sheridan to keep a marshal reasonably
busy, without dippin&rsquo; into private matters. I
rather reckon you can take care of yourself, but if
you need me, old boy I&rsquo;m always right here on
the job. You know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, Bill, and appreciate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The group about the motionless body fell away, and
made room for the marshal, the last man to rise saying
soberly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead all right, Hickock. I guess
he never knew what hit him. Good shootin&rsquo;, too,
dark as it is here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had the range fixed, likely,&rdquo; returned
the marshal. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes it look
like it was arranged for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent down, striving to distinguish the dead man&rsquo;s
features turned up to the drizzle, but the night revealed
the faintest outline.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anybody know him?&rdquo; There was no response,
only a shuffling of feet in the mud. &ldquo;Here you
man with the lantern, hold it over where I can see.
There, that is better. Now, you fellows take a look,
and see if some of you can&rsquo;t name the poor devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They glanced down, one after the other, over Bill&rsquo;s
shoulder, shading their eyes from the rain so as to
see clearer. The light of the flickering lantern streamed
full on the ghastly face, but each man shook his head,
and passed on. Keith hung back, hoping some one would
identify the body, and not make it necessary for him
to take part in the grewsome task. It was not likely
to be any one he knew, and besides, he felt the man
had died in his stead, and he dreaded to look upon
the stricken face. When the last of the group had
drifted back out of the radius of light, Hickock looked
up, and saw him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Jack,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;you
better try--you might know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith bent over, and looked down. As he did so his
heart seemed to rise choking into his throat, and
a blur obscured his sight. He swept a hand over his
eyes and dropped on his knees into the mud beside the
body, staring speechless into the white face, the
sightless eyes. Hickock watching him closely, and
gripped his arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God, yes; Fred Willoughby!&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXV"></a>Chapter XXV</h1>

<h2>A Reappearance of the General</h2>

<p>Keith did not inform Hope of her brother&rsquo;s death
until the following morning, but had the body properly
prepared for burial, and devoted the remainder of
the night to searching for General Waite and, incidentally,
for both Hawley and Scott. Both Hickock and Fairbain
assisted in this effort to learn the whereabouts of
the dead boy&rsquo;s father, but without the slightest
result, nor did Keith&rsquo;s investigations reveal
the gambler at any of his accustomed resorts, while
Scott had apparently made a complete get-away. These
disappearances merely served to convince him as to
the truth of his first suspicions; Scott might have
departed for good, but Hawley would certainly reappear
just so soon as assured his name had not been mentioned
in connection with the tragedy. To Neb alone did the
plainsman candidly confide his belief in the guilt
of these two, and when other duties called him elsewhere,
he left the negro scouring the town for any possible
reappearance of either.</p>

<p>Heavy-eyed from lack of sleep, heavy-hearted with
his message, yet fully decided as to what advice he
should offer, Keith returned to the hotel, and requested
an interview with Hope. Although still comparatively
early, some premonition of evil had awakened the girl,
and in a very few moments she was prepared to receive
her visitor. A questioning glance into his face was
sufficient to assure her of unpleasant news, but, with
one quick breath, she grasped his arm as though his
very presence afforded her strength.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How tired you look! Something has occurred
to keep you out all night-- and--and I know you have
brought me bad news. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell
me; I can bear anything better than suspense. Is it
about father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Hope,&rdquo; and he took her hand, and
led her to a chair. Bending above her he gave her
the whole story of the night, and she scarcely interrupted
with a question, sitting there dry-eyed, with only
an occasional sob shaking her slender form. As he
ended, she looked up into his face, and now he could
see a mist of unshed tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall I do, Captain Keith? I am all alone
with this, except for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have considered that, Hope,&rdquo; he answered,
gravely, &ldquo;and it seems to me your present duty
is more to the living than the dead. You should remain
here until we learn something definite regarding your
father, and discover the truth of this conspiracy
formed against him. If Fred could know the trouble
his chance words have caused, he would wish you to
do this. With him gone, we are going to find the unravelling
harder than ever. It is my judgment, Hope, your brother
should be buried here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shuddered, her hands pressed to her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, on that horrible &rsquo;Boots Hill&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only temporarily, little girl,&rdquo; his voice
full of deepest sympathy. &ldquo;In a few weeks, perhaps,
it could be removed East.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was silent for what seemed to him a long while;
then she looked up into his face, clinging to his
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that will be best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That same afternoon, the sun low in the west, they
placed the dead boy in his shallow grave on &ldquo;Boots
Hill.&rdquo; It was a strange funeral, in a strange
environment--all about the barren, deserted plains;
far away to the east and west, the darker line marking
the railroad grade, and just below, nestled close
in against the foot of the hill, the squalid town of
tents and shacks. There were not many to stand beside
the open grave, for few in Sheridan knew the lad,
and funerals were not uncommon--some cronies, half-drunk
and maudlin, awed somewhat by the presence of the marshal,
Doctor Fairbain, Keith, and Hope. That was all excepting
the post chaplain from Fort Hays, who, inspired by
a glimpse of the girl&rsquo;s unveiled face, spoke
simple words of comfort. It was all over with quickly,
and with the red sun still lingering on the horizon,
the little party slowly wended their way back, down
the steep trail into the one long street of Sheridan.</p>

<p>At the hotel Neb was waiting, the whites of his eyes
shining with excitement, his pantomime indicating
important news. As soon as he could leave Hope, Keith
hurried down to interview his dusky satellite, who
appeared about to burst with restrained information.
As soon as uncorked that individual began to flow
volubly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sho&rsquo; done seed &rsquo;em, Massa Jack;
I done seed &rsquo;em both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Both? Both who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Massa Waite, sah, an&rsquo; dat black debble
dat we was huntin&rsquo; fo&rsquo;. It was a mos&rsquo;
surprisin&rsquo; circumstance, sah--a mos&rsquo; surprisin&rsquo;
circumstance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go on; where did you see them? Do you
mean they were together?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The negro took a long breath, evidently overcome by
the importance of his message, and unable to conjure
up words wholly satisfactory to his ideas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sho&rsquo; am de strangest t&rsquo;ing,
Massa Jack, ebber I prognosticated. I was jest comin&rsquo;
roun&rsquo; de corner ob Sheeny Joe&rsquo;s shebang,
back dar by de blacksmith shop, when--de Lawd save
me!--yere come ol&rsquo; Massa Waite, a ridin&rsquo;
&rsquo;long on a cream colo&rsquo;d pinto just as much
alibe as ebber he was. Yas, sah; he&rsquo;s whiskers
was blowin&rsquo; round, an&rsquo; I could eben yeah
him cussin&rsquo; de hoss, when he done shy at a man
what got up sudden like from a cart-wheel he was settin&rsquo;
on. I done took one look at dat sec&oacute;n&rsquo; fellar,
and seed it was dat black debble from down Carson way.
Den I ducked inter de blacksmith shop out &lsquo;er
sight. I sho&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t want Mister Hawley
to git no chance at dis nigger--I sho&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they speak to one another?&rdquo; Keith
asked, anxiously. &ldquo;Did you hear what was said?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sho&rsquo; dey talked, Massa Jack. I sorter
reckon dey was dar for dat special purpose. Sutt&rsquo;nly,
sah, dey went right at talkin&rsquo; like dey hed som&rsquo;t&rsquo;ing
on dey minds. &Ouml;l&rsquo; Massa Waite was a sittin&rsquo;
straight up on de hoss, an&rsquo; dat black debble
was a standin&rsquo; dar in front ob him. &Ouml;l&rsquo;
Massa Waite he was mad from de first jump off, an&rsquo;
I could heah most eberyt&rsquo;ing he said, but Mr.
Hawley he grin de same way he do when he deal faro,
an&rsquo; speaks kinder low. De ol&rsquo; man he swear
fine at him, he call him eberyt&rsquo;ing--a damn
liar, a damn scoundrel--but Mr. Hawley he jest grin,
and say ober de same ting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was that, Neb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Som&rsquo;t&rsquo;ing &lsquo;bout a gal, Massa
Jack--an&rsquo; a law suit--an&rsquo; how de ol&rsquo;
man better settle up widout no fightin&rsquo;. I jest
didn&rsquo;t git de whole ob it, he talked so low
like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Waite say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, mostly he jest cussed. He sho&rsquo;
told dat black debble &rsquo;bout what he thought
ob him, but he didn&rsquo;t nebber once call him Hawley--no,
sah, not once; he done call him Bartlett, or somet&rsquo;ing
or odder like dat. But he sutt&rsquo;nly read dat
man&rsquo;s pedigree from way back to de time ob de
flood, I reck&rsquo;n. An&rsquo; he done swore he&rsquo;d
fight for whatebber it was, papers or no papers. Den
Hawley, he got plumb tired ob de ol&rsquo; man swearin&rsquo;
at him, an&rsquo; he grabbed a picter out ob he&rsquo;s
pocket, an&rsquo; says, &rsquo;Damn you; look at dat!
What kind ob a fight can yo&rsquo; make against dat
face?&rsquo; De ol&rsquo; man stared at it a while,
sorter chokin&rsquo; up; den he say softer like: &rsquo;It&rsquo;s
Hope; where did yo&rsquo; ebber get dat?&rsquo; and
de black debble he laughed, an&rsquo; shoved de picter
back into he&rsquo;s pocket. &lsquo;Hope, hell!&rsquo;
he say, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s Phyllis, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
put her before any jury yo&rsquo;re mind to get--oh,
I&rsquo;ve got yo&rsquo; nailed, Waite, dis time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;De ol&rsquo; gin&rsquo;ral he didn&rsquo;t
seem ter know what ter say; he done set dar lookin&rsquo;
off ober de prairie like he was clar flumegasted. He
sho&rsquo; did look like dat black debble hed hit
him mighty hard. Den he says slow like, turnin&rsquo;
his hoss &rsquo;round: &lsquo;Bartlett, yo&rsquo; am
puttin&rsquo; up a good bluff, but, by Gawd, I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; ter call yo&rsquo;. Yo&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
get a cent ob dat money &rsquo;less yo&rsquo; put
up de proof. I&rsquo;ll meet yo&rsquo; whar yo&rsquo;
say, but ef I can git hol&rsquo; ob some papers dat&rsquo;s
missin&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll take dat grin off yo&rsquo;
face.&rsquo; De odder one laughed, an&rsquo; de ol&rsquo;
gin&rsquo;ral started fo&rsquo; ter ride away, den
he pull up he&rsquo;s hoss, an&rsquo; look back. &lsquo;Yo&rsquo;
sorter herd wid dat kind ob cattle, Bartlett,&rsquo;
he say, sharp like, &lsquo;maybe yo&rsquo; know a gambler
roun&rsquo; yere called Hawley?&rsquo; De black debble
nebber eben lose he&rsquo;s grin. &lsquo;Do yo&rsquo;
mean Black Bart Hawley?&rsquo; &lsquo;Dat&rsquo;s
the man, where is he?&rsquo; &lsquo;Dealin&rsquo; faro
fo&rsquo; Mike Kenna in Topeka a week ago--friend
ob yours?&rsquo; &lsquo;Dat&rsquo;s none ob yo&rsquo;
damned business,&rsquo; snorted de ol&rsquo; gin&rsquo;ral,
givin&rsquo; his hoss de spur. Sho&rsquo;, Massa Jack,
he nebber knowed he was talkin&rsquo; ter dat same
Hawley, an&rsquo; dat black debble jest laughed as
he rode off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was all this, Neb?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bout de time yo&rsquo; all went up on
de hill, I reck&rsquo;n. I done come right yere, and
waited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith walked across the room, selected a cigar, and
came back, his mind busy with the problem. Hawley
had in some manner, then, got into communication with
Waite, and was threatening him. But Waite evidently
knew the man under another name--his given name--and
the gambler had sent him off on a false trail. The
lost papers apparently contained the solution to all
this mystery. Waite believed Hawley possessed them,
but did not suspect that Bartlett and Hawley were
the same person. What would he most naturally do now?
Seek Hawley in Topeka probably; seize the first opportunity
of getting there. Keith turned impatiently to the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any train running east?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they generally start one out every day,&rdquo;,
with a glance toward the clock, &ldquo;&rsquo;long
&rsquo;bout this time. Maybe it&rsquo;s gone, and maybe
it hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was already nearly dark outside as the two men
hastened toward the depot. They arrived there barely
in time to see the red lights on the last car disappear.
No inquiries made of those lounging about brought results--they had been interested in a lot of drunken graders
loaded on the flat cars by force, and sent out under
guard--and not one could tell whether any man answering
Waite&rsquo;s description was in the single passenger
coach. Convinced, however, that the General would
waste no time in prosecuting his search, Keith believed
him already on his way east, and after dismissing
Neb, with instructions to watch out closely for Hawley,
he made his own way back to the hotel.</p>

<p>It seemed strange enough how completely he was blocked
each time, just as he thought the whole baffling mystery
was about to be made clear. Hawley was playing in
rare luck, all the cards running easily to his hand,
thus, at least, gaining time, and strengthening his
position. There could no longer be any doubt that
the gambler possessed some knowledge which made him
a formidable adversary. From Waite&rsquo;s statement
it was the loss of the papers which left him helpless
to openly resist the claim being made upon him on
behalf of the mysterious Phyllis. His only hope, therefore,
lay in recovering these; but, with time limited, he
had been sent back on a wild goose chase, while Keith
alone knew, with any degree of positiveness, where
those documents really were. Hawley certainly had them
in his possession the day before, for he had taken
them to Miss Maclaire to thus convince her as to the
truth of his statements. And Hawley was still in Sheridan.
However, it was not likely the man would risk carrying
documents of such value, and documents connecting
him so closely with that murder on the Santa F&eacute; Trail,
about upon his person. At best, life was cheap in that
community, and Black Bart must possess enemies in plenty.
Yet if not on his person--where? Scott was only a
tool, a mere ignorant desperado, not to be trusted
to such a degree--yet apparently he was the only one
working with the gambler in this deal, the only one
cognizant as to his plans. Christie--Keith came to
a stop in the street at the recurrence of the woman&rsquo;s
name. Why not? If she had been convinced, if she really
believed that these papers proved her right to both
property and parentage, then she would guard them
as a tigress does her young. And Hawley would know
that, and must realize they would be far safer in her
hands than in his pocket. She could not use them without
his aid and guidance, and yet, whatever happened to
him, they would still be safely beyond reach. True,
this might not have been done; the gambler might not
yet have felt that he had sufficient hold upon the
woman to trust her thus far, but it was, at least,
a possibility to be considered, and acted upon.</p>

<p>Still wrestling with the intricate problem, Keith
entered the dining-room, and weaved his way, as usual,
through the miscellaneous crowd, toward the more exclusive
tables at the rear. A woman sat alone at one of these,
her back toward the door. His first thought was that
it must be Hope, and he advanced toward her, his heart
throbbing. She glanced up, a slight frown wrinkling
her forehead, and he bowed, recognizing Christie Maclaire.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXVI"></a>Chapter XXVI</h1>

<h2>A Chance Conversation</h2>

<p>The opportunity thus so unexpectedly afforded was
not one to be wasted, and Keith accepted it with swift
determination. The expression in the woman&rsquo;s
face was scarcely one of welcome, yet his purpose was
sufficiently serious to cause him to ignore this with
easy confidence in himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, indeed, most fortunate to discover you
alone, Miss Maclaire,&rdquo; he said, avoiding her
eyes by a swift glance over the table, &ldquo;and evidently
at a time when you are only beginning your meal. May
I join you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She hesitated for an instant, debating with herself,
and as quickly deciding on disagreeable tactics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume this is a public table, and I consequently
have little choice in the matter, if you insist,&rdquo;
she replied, her voice more civil than her words.
&ldquo;Still, Mr. Keith, I am not accustomed to associating
with criminals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He smiled, holding his temper in check, more than
ever determined to win.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, possibly, you may rather welcome a new
diversion. I can assure you our criminals out here
are the most interesting portion of our population.
I wish I might have your permission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Standing there before her, bare-headed, his slightly
tanned face strong and manly, his gray eyes filled
with humor, Miss Maclaire recognized again that he
was not of the common herd, and the innate coquetry
of her nature obtained mastery. What harm could it
do for her to chat with him for half an hour? It was
better than eating a lonely meal, and, besides, she
might learn something of value to report to Hawley.
Her own eyes brightened, the slight frown disappearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are certainly an illustration of your theory,&rdquo;
she said pleasantly. &ldquo;I shall have to say yes,
but, really, I did not suppose you would enjoy being
ranked among that class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew out a chair, and sat down facing her, leaning
slightly forward upon the intervening table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor would I, only I recognize you do not comprehend.
The source of your information is a bit polluted,
Miss Maclaire. There are those whose good opinion
I do not seek, and you should not form your decisions
on the unsupported testimony of a personal enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; rather resenting the words,
and already regretful of her compliance. &ldquo;Surely
I have as much reason to trust my informant as I have
you. He, at least, has proven himself a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could feel as fully assured of that
as you do,&rdquo; he returned honestly. &ldquo;I would
then have every temptation to meddle further taken
away from me. Do you realize that my interest is very
largely upon your account?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; laughing, &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
believe that. I--I have heard it whispered it might
be because of the other girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other girl!&rdquo; in complete surprise
at this swift return.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; conscious of having attained
the upper hand. &ldquo;Miss Hope Waite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some more of Mr. Hawley&rsquo;s fancies,&rdquo;
he retorted, perplexed that so much should be suspected.
&ldquo;Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course. I am a woman, Mr. Keith, with
all the natural curiosity of my sex. In this case
I had special reason to be interested. One does not
meet her counterpart every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The resemblance between you is certainly most
striking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sufficiently so,&rdquo; she said slowly, her
eyes on his face, &ldquo;to abundantly confirm in
my mind the truth of all that has been told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The waiter approached with the orders, and the two
remained in silence  until he had deposited his load
upon the table, and departed. She was watching the
face opposite through lowered lashes that veiled her
eyes, but Keith was first to break the stillness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I might be told what that was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what do you refer?&rdquo; apparently forgetful
as to where their conversation had been broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Hawley&rsquo;s proposition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; her lips smiling, &ldquo;but
you have come to the wrong market, Mr. Jack Keith.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; he insisted earnestly, &ldquo;if
this is all straight, with no fraud concealed anywhere,
if you have the proofs in your hands, why are you
afraid to talk openly? The very manner in which Hawley
works should convince you he is himself afraid to
face the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you are wrong. There are perfectly satisfactory
reasons why we should for the present keep our plans
secret. There are details yet to be decided upon,
and Mr. Hawley&rsquo;s present objection to publicity
is only ordinary prudence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She leaned toward him, her fingers playing nervously
with a knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Keith, I cannot help but like you, and
I also feel most kindly disposed toward Mr. Hawley.
I wish in this I was no longer compelled to consider
you an enemy to us both. There is no reason why I should,
except for your blind prejudice against this other
man who is my friend. I know you have some cause,
for he has told me the entire story, yet I am sure
he did no more than his actual duty. He let me realize
how very sorry he was that the marshal at Carson City
had called upon him for assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? Hawley?&rdquo; Keith questioned, hardly
trusting his own ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; indeed he is a very different man from
what you have been led to believe. I know he is a
gambler, and all that, but really it is not altogether
his fault. He told me about his life, and it was very
sad. He was driven from home when only a boy, and
naturally drifted into evil company. His one ambition
is, to break away, and redeem himself. I am so anxious
to help him, and wish you could realize his purpose,
as I do, and become his friend. Won&rsquo;t you, for
my sake? Why, even in this affair he has not the slightest
mercenary purpose--he has only thought of what was
rightfully mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith listened, feeling to the full the woman&rsquo;s
earnestness, the impossibility of changing her fixed
conviction. Hawley had planted his seed deep and well
in fruitful soil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make a strong and charming advocate, Miss
Maclaire,&rdquo; he returned, feeling the necessity
of saying something. &ldquo;I should like to have you
equally earnest on my side. Yet it will be hard to
convince me that &rsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; is the paragon
of virtue you describe. I wish I might believe for
your sake. Did he also explain how he came into possession
of these papers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed; there is no secret about that.
They were entrusted to him by an old man whom he discovered
sick in Independence, and who died in his rooms three
years ago. Mr. Hawley has been searching ever since
for the old man&rsquo;s grand-daughter. It is remarkable
how he was finally convinced that I was the one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A photograph, was it not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A gleam of sudden suspicion appeared in the brown
eyes, a slight change in facial expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a clue, yes, but far from being all.
But why should I tell you this?--you believe nothing
I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe that you believe; that you are fully
convinced of the justice of your claim. Perhaps it
is just, but I am suspicious of anything which Bart
Hawley has a hand in. Miss Christie, you really make
me wish to retain your friendship, but I cannot do
so if the cost includes faith in Hawley. Do you know
that is not even his name--that he lives under an
alias?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything strange in that out here?&rdquo;
she asked stoutly. &ldquo;I told you how deeply he
regretted his life; that alone would be sufficient
cause for him to drop his family name. Did you ever
learn his true name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was not sure--only as Neb had reported what Waite
had called the man, yet ventured a direct reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bartlett, I believe--he uses it now as a prefix.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bartlett!--Bartlett!&rdquo; her hands clasping,
and unclasping nervously. &ldquo;Why, what a strange
coincidence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing--nothing,&rdquo; biting her lips
in vexation. &ldquo;The name merely recalled something.
But really I must go, Mr. Keith, or I shall be late
at the theatre. You have not attended since I came?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; arising from the table with her.
&ldquo;However, I have heard you sing before, and
hope I may again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How tenderly you dwell on that word &lsquo;hope,&rsquo;&rdquo;
she said banteringly, &ldquo;it almost makes me envious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your resemblance almost makes me forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not quite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not quite,&rdquo; he confessed, smiling
back into her quizzing eyes.</p>

<p>They went out into the hall together, only to meet
with Doctor Fairbain at the door. The latter stared
at the two with some embarrassment, for a moment forgetful
of his purpose. His gaze settled on the face of the
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Always getting you two mixed,&rdquo; he blurted
forth. &ldquo;Never saw such resemblance--positively
uncanny--same hotel too means trouble--this Miss Waite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Doctor; I am Miss Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ought to have known it--if I knew as much about
faces as I do about anatomy never would make such
mistake--very sorry--what fooled me was seeing you
with Keith--thought he was after the other one--gay
dog though --never satisfied--was hunting after you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After me?&rdquo; evidently amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly--you--went to the room--then to the
clerk--said you were in at supper--just occurred to
me streets here bad at night--thought I&rsquo;d ask
you to let me escort you to theatre and back--a bit
of lunch later--&rdquo; he glanced suspiciously at
Keith--&ldquo;probably got here too late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well really you have, Doctor,&rdquo; she replied
sweetly, veiling her eyes to hide their laughter.
&ldquo;But I can assure you it is not Mr. Keith,&rdquo;
courtesying slightly to the latter, &ldquo;for he has
not honored me; we merely met by chance at the table.
I am sure I should enjoy your company exceedingly,
but to-night I must plead a previous engagement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah--ah, some other night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor faded away into the office, not wholly
satisfied because Keith still lingered. Miss Christie
extended her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he a funny man? But I do like him--someway
I like so many people whom perhaps I ought not, including
you, Mr. Jack Keith. Please think over what I told
you about Mr. Hawley, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly; you have given me food for thought.
I presume he is to be your escort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bowed, evidently resenting the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it may interest you to know that he
has something of the utmost importance to tell me
to-night--he has actually seen my guardian. Don&rsquo;t
you wish you could be there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She gave him a tantalizing smile, withdrawing her
hand, and running up the stairs before he could answer.
Over the railing of the landing she glanced down,
and then disappeared.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXVII"></a>Chapter XXVII</h1>

<h2>Miss Hope Suggests</h2>

<p>No sooner had Miss Maclaire vanished than Keith&rsquo;s
thoughts turned toward Hope Waite. She would need
someone in her loneliness to take her mind from off
her brother&rsquo;s death, and, besides, much had occurred
of interest since the funeral, which he desired to
talk over with her. Beyond even these considerations
he was becoming aware of a pleasure in the girl&rsquo;s
company altogether foreign to this mystery which they
were endeavoring together to solve. He yearned to
be with her, to look into her face, to mark how clearly
the differing soul changed her from Christie Maclaire.
He could not help but like the latter, yet somehow
was conscious of totally different atmospheres surrounding
the two. With one he could be flippant, careless,
even deceitful, but the other aroused only the best
that was in him, her own sincerity making him sincere.</p>

<p>Yet there was reluctance in his steps as he approached
the door of &ldquo;15,&rdquo; a laggardness he could
not explain, but which vanished swiftly enough at
Hope&rsquo;s greeting, and the sudden smile with which
she recognized him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was sure you would come,&rdquo; she declared
frankly, &ldquo;and I took an early lunch so as to
be certain and be here. It has seemed a long time since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you might have even thought I had forgotten,&rdquo;
he answered, releasing her hand reluctantly, &ldquo;if
you could have looked into the dining-room since,
instead of staring out of these windows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? How forgotten?&rdquo; her eyes opening
wide in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had the pleasure of taking supper with Miss
Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the exclamation decidedly expressive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I come at once to you with the confession.
However, our meeting was purely accidental, and so
I hope for pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon from me? Why, what difference can it
possibly make to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you have me consort with the enemy?&rdquo;
he asked, scarcely daring to press his deeper meaning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not. What did you talk about?
Do you mind telling?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least; our conversation was entirely
impersonal. She was telling me about Hawley; what
a wonderfully good man he is. I have begun to suspect
the fellow has fascinated the poor girl--he is a good
looking devil, possessed of a tongue dripping with
honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely you do not mean she has fallen in love
with him,&rdquo; and Hope shuddered at the thought.
&ldquo;Why--why that would be impossible for--for a
good woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Standards of morality are not always the same,&rdquo;
he defended gravely. &ldquo;Miss Maclaire&rsquo;s
environment has been vastly different from yours, Hope.
She is a variety hall singer; probably, from her own
account, a waif since childhood; and Hawley has come
to her in the character of a friend, appealing both
to her interest and sympathy. I do not know she is
in love with him, I merely suspect she may be; certainly
she is ready to do battle on his behalf at the slightest
opportunity. She believes in him, defends him, and
resents the slightest insinuation directed against
him. He even escorts her back and forth from her work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do,&rdquo; and he laughed at the
recollection. &ldquo;Fairbain met us coming out of
the dining-room,--you know what a delightful, blunt,
blundering old fellow he is! Well, Miss Christie must
have made an impression even on his bachelor heart,
for he actually requested the privilege of escorting
her to the Trocadero, and back to the hotel after
the performance to-night--hinted at a lunch, the gay
old dog, and pranced about like a stage-door Johnnie.
It was a treat to watch her face when he blurted it
all out, snapping his sentences as if he swung a whip-lash.
She excused herself on the score of a previous engagement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that was not necessarily with Hawley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked her directly, after the doctor had
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have become very familiar,&rdquo;
questioning once again in her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So Miss Maclaire evidently thought, judging
from her manner. However she answered frankly enough,
and, even defiantly, added the information that the
gentleman had something to impart to her of the utmost
importance, sarcastically asking me if I didn&rsquo;t
wish I could be there and overhear. But sit down,
Hope, until I tell you all that has occurred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went over the various events in detail, watching
eagerly the expression upon her face as she listened
intently, only occasionally interrupting with some
pertinent inquiry. The light fell so that she sat partially
in the shadow, where her eyes could not be read, yet
he experienced no difficulty in comprehending the
various moods with which she met his narrative, the
color changing in her cheeks, her supple form bending
toward him, or leaning backward in the chair, her fingers
clasping or unclasping in nervous attention. He began
with Neb&rsquo;s report, repeating, word by word,
as nearly as he could recollect, what had passed between
Hawley and her father. He paused to inquire if she
had ever heard the name Bartlett, but her reply was
merely a negative shake of the head. When he described
their missing the train, she was, apparently, not convinced
as to the General&rsquo;s departure upon it, although
finally agreeing that, if he really believed the report
that the man sought was elsewhere, it would be characteristic
of him to accept the first means of getting there.
&ldquo;If he only knew I was here,&rdquo; she exclaimed
wearily, &ldquo;it might be so different, but, oh,
we are all of us just groping in the dark.&rdquo; Then
Keith turned to his chance meeting with Miss Maclaire,
and repeated carefully their conversation, dwelling
particularly upon the few admissions which had slipped
through her lips. These did not seem important to either,
although they treasured them up and talked them over.
Then, having exhausted the topic, silence fell between
them, Keith asking the privilege of lighting a cigar.
Hope, after watching him apply the match, thinking
what a fine face he had as the ruddy flame brought
it forth with the clearness of a cameo, leaned back,
drawing aside the semblance to a lace curtain, and
staring forth, without seeing, into the street.</p>

<p>Somehow it was hard for her to fully realize the situation,
and how closely it affected her. The swiftly passing
events, the complication arising so suddenly, apparently
out of nothing, left her feeling as though she must
surely awake from a dream. She could not comprehend
what it was all about; the names Bartlett and Phyllis
had no clear meaning, they represented nothing but
shadows; and this other woman--this music hall singer--what
could there be in common between them? Yet there must
be something--something of vital importance to her
father--something which had already cost her brother&rsquo;s
life. That was the one thing which made it seem an
actuality--which brought it home to her as a rugged
fact. But for that--and Keith--Keith sitting there
before her--she would have doubted it all. And yet
even Keith had come into her life so suddenly, so
unexpectedly, as to leave her dazed and uncertain.
So strongly did this feeling grip her in the silence,
that she extended her hand and touched him, as though
to make sure of his actual presence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing--nothing,&rdquo; her voice breaking
in a little sob. &ldquo;It is so silly, but I was
just wondering if you were real--everything seems so
impossible. I cannot bring my mind to grasp the situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not smile, but only took the groping hand into
both of his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I understand, little girl,&rdquo; he
said gravely. &ldquo;You are totally unused to such
life. Almost without a moment&rsquo;s warning you have
been plunged into a maelstrom of adventure, and are
all confused. It is different with me--since the first
shot at Sumter my life has been one of action, and
adventure has grown to be the stimulus I need, and
upon which I thrive. But I assure you,&rdquo; pressing
the soft hand warmly, &ldquo;I am real.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I know that; it makes me glad to
know it. If I could only do something myself, and
not just sit here, it would all become real enough
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose suddenly to her feet, clasping her hands
together, her face changing with new animation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t I? I am sure I could. Oh,
Mr. Keith, it has just come to me how I can help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her questioningly, thinking of her beauty
rather than of what she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do--do I really appear so much like--like that
woman?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much, indeed, excepting for the slight
difference in age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would never be noticed in the dark, or
a poor light. Am I the same height?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Practically, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And my voice?--could you distinguish me from
her by my voice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might; yet probably not, unless my suspicions
were aroused. What is it you are thinking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took a deep breath, standing now directly facing
him in the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of playing Miss Maclaire to-night,&rdquo; she
said quickly. &ldquo;Of taking her place, and learning
what it is of so much importance Hawley has to report.
Don&rsquo;t you think it might be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sheer audacity of this unexpected proposal left
him speechless. He arose to his feet, gripping the
back of the chair, almost doubting if he could have
heard aright, his eyes searching the girl&rsquo;s face
which was glowing with excitement. Of course he could
not permit of her exposure to such a risk; the scheme
was impracticable, absurd. But was it? Did it not
offer a fair chance of success? And was not the possible
result worthy the risk assumed? He choked back the
earlier words of protest unuttered, puzzled as to
what he had best say. A quick-witted resourceful woman
might accomplish all she proposed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks so simple,&rdquo; she broke in impulsively,
moving nearer him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I
could do it? Would it be unwomanly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The result, if accomplished, would abundantly
justify the means, Hope,&rdquo; he acknowledged at
last. &ldquo;I was not hesitating on that account,
but considering the risk you would incur.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be so small--merely the short walk
alone with him from the theatre to the hotel,&rdquo;
she pleaded. &ldquo;Once here it could make no difference
if he did discover my identity, for there would be
plenty of men near at hand to come to my defence.
Oh, please say yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do, then we must make the illusion perfect,
and take as few chances of discovery as possible.
I must learn exactly how the other dresses, and when
she leaves the theatre. Fortunately for the success
of your plan the Trocadero permits no one but performers
to come behind the scenes, so that Hawley will be
compelled to wait for the lady outside the stage door.
I had better go at once, and see to these details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, her eyes sparkling with
anticipation, &ldquo;and I am so glad you are willing.
I will be most discreet. You are not sorry I made the
proposal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. At first it struck me as altogether
wrong, but the more I think of it the stronger it
appeals to me. It may reveal to us the whole conspiracy,
and I cannot believe Hawley would venture upon any
gross familiarity likely to cost him the good opinion
of his ally. There is too much at stake. Wait here,
Hope, and I will be back the very moment I learn all
that is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A glance at the office clock convinced Keith that,
in all probability, Miss Maclaire had not, as yet,
departed for the scene of her evening triumph. Still,
it could not be long before she would, and he lit a
cigar, sitting down in a corner partially concealed
by the clerk&rsquo;s desk to wait her appearance.
This required longer than anticipated, and fearing
lest he might have missed the departure entirely,
he was about to question the busy Thomas, when he
beheld Hawley enter hurriedly from the street and run
up the stairs. He then had been the laggard. All the
better, as he would now have no opportunity to unfold
his tale to the lady, as it would be necessary for
them to hurry to the theatre. Whatever the nature of
the revelation it would have to wait until the walk
home. The excitement of the adventure was already
creeping into Keith&rsquo;s blood, his pulse quickening.</p>

<p>The two returned almost immediately, conclusively
proving that Miss Maclaire, fully dressed for the
street, had been awaiting the arrival of her gallant
with some impatience. Hawley was busily explaining
his delay as they came down the stairs, and paid little
attention to the seemingly deserted office. Indeed,
Miss Christie monopolized all his thoughts. With quick
scrutiny the watcher noted the more conspicuous articles
of apparel constituting her costume--the white mantilla
thrown over her head, the neatly fitting blue dress,
the light cape covering the shoulders--surely it would
not be difficult to duplicate these, so as to pass
muster under the dim light of the streets. Far enough
in their rear to feel safe from observation he followed,
noting with increased pleasure the rapidity with which
they covered the required distance. Clearly Miss Christie
was already nervous lest she have not sufficient time
remaining in which to properly dress for her act,
and there would be no exchange of confidences on the
outward journey. Hawley left her, as Keith anticipated,
at the stage entrance, the lady hastening within.
Her escort strolled leisurely back to the front of
the house, and finally, purchasing a ticket, entered,
the performance already having begun.</p>

<p>Keith knew perfectly the arrangement of the theatre--the
seats in front; tables all through the centre; a gallery
filled with benches; a noisy orchestra beneath the
stage; a crowded audience of men, with only here and
there a scattered representative of the gentler sex;
busy waiters dodging in and out among the tables,
and down the aisles, filling orders for liquids from
the nearby saloon. The air would be pungent with the
odor of drink, thick with the fumes of tobacco, and
noisy with voices, except as some special favorite
on the stage won temporary attention. The Trocadero
possessed but one redeeming feature--no doorway connected
stage and auditorium, and the management brooked no
interference with his artists. It had required some
nerve to originally enforce this rule, together with
a smart fight or two, but at this period it was acknowledged
and respected. No sooner had Hawley vanished than
Keith found occasion to enter into casual conversation
with the door-keeper, asking a number of questions,
and leaving impressed upon the mind of that astute
individual the idea that he was dealing with a &ldquo;gent&rdquo;
enamored of one of the stage beauties. A coin slipped
quietly into the man&rsquo;s hand served to deepen
this impression, and unlocked discreet lips otherwise
sworn to secrecy. Out of much general information
a little of real value was thus extracted--Miss Maclaire&rsquo;s
act began at 9:45 and was over promptly at 10:10. It
required about twenty minutes more for her to change
again into street clothes, and she usually left the
theatre immediately after, which would be about 10:30.
Yes, there was a vestibule outside the stage door,
and on bad nights, those waiting for the ladies could
slip in there. But on such a night as this they generally
hung around outside. No, there was no watchman, but
the manager was frequently prowling around. He&rsquo;d
be busy, however, at 10:30, getting the stage ready
for the &ldquo;Flying Hermanns.&rdquo; Abundantly
satisfied and resisting the door-keeper&rsquo;s professional
suggestion that he&rsquo;d better buy a ticket and
take a look at the show, Keith slipped away, and hastened
back to the hotel. The more he investigated the more
feasible appeared the girl&rsquo;s plan, and he was
now fully committed to it.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXVIII"></a>Chapter XXVIII</h1>

<h2>The Stage Door of the Trocadero</h2>

<p>Hope discovered very little difficulty in duplicating
the outer garments Keith reported Miss Maclaire as
wearing. The colors, indeed, were not exactly the
same, yet this difference was not sufficient to be
noticeable at night by the eyes of a man who had no
reason to suspect deceit. The girl was in a flutter
of nervous excitement as she hastened about the room,
donning her few requirements of masquerade, yet Keith
noted with appreciation that she became perceptibly
cooler as the moment of departure approached. With
cheeks aflame and eyes sparkling, yet speaking with
a voice revealing no falter, she pressed his arm and
declared herself prepared for the ordeal. The face
under the shadow of the mantilla was so arch and piquant,
Keith could not disguise his admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I Christie Maclaire?&rdquo; she asked laughingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sufficiently so to fool our friend,&rdquo;
he returned, &ldquo;but I am ready to swear that lady
never looked so charming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A compliment, and spoken as though you really
meant it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not been honest enough with you in the
past, to be credited with honesty now?&rdquo; he protested,
a little hurt by the bantering tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you have; I merely talk lightly to
keep my courage up. You can have no idea how afraid
I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are truly an actress, for you appear
the picture of enjoyment. But we must go, or Hawley
will be there before us, and thus spoil all our plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They passed out through the office together, seeing
no one familiar to either, Hope keeping her face partially
concealed. The east side of the street was less frequented
than the other, having fewer saloons along its way,
and they chose its darkness. As they advanced, the
long habit of frontier life caused Keith to glance
behind before they had progressed a block, and he
was thus made aware that they were being followed.
Conversing lightly, and without a word to alarm the
girl, he yet managed to observe every movement of
the dimly outlined figure which advanced with them,
timing every motion to theirs. Long before they crossed
the street to the Trocadero he was convinced there
was no mistake--the fellow, whoever he might be, was
trailing them. Keith smiled grimly to himself, resolving
that, as soon as he had left the lady, he would teach
the spy a lesson not soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p>They barely entered the outer circle of the Trocadero
lights, noting a group of men thronging about the
doors, and hearing the sound of the band within, and
then turned swiftly down the narrow dark alley-way
leading toward the stage entrance. Keith, having been
there before, advanced confidently, but Hope, her
heart beating wildly, clung to his arm, scarcely venturing
a word in reply to his whispered assurances. Fortunately
they encountered no one, and Keith, feeling cautiously
in the dark, easily succeeded in locating the opening
to the vestibule. Listening intently he became convinced
that no one occupied the little shed. He had intended
to remain with the girl until the time came for her
to emerge, but the remembrance of that figure dogging
them all the way from the hotel now caused a change
of plan. He held her hand closely clasped in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Hope, I am going to leave you,&rdquo;
he whispered, &ldquo;and your own wit will have to
carry you through. I know you will play your part all
right, and it will be mine to wait for Christie, and
give her some explanation of why Hawley failed to
meet her as he promised. It will never do for her to
suspect, until you time to learn all possible. You
are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; clinging to him, &ldquo;but--but
I am going through it just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The truest kind of courage, my girl. Now slip
inside, but hold the door ajar. Hawley will certainly
be here within ten minutes, and you must join him
at once, or else the other might appear. You can judge
as to its being him even in this darkness. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The longing to clasp her in his arms, to speak the
language of his heart, was almost overwhelming, yet
the memory of that figure slinking along behind them,
and the brief time before Hawley&rsquo;s probable appearance,
for he would leave the theatre at the conclusion of
Miss Maclaire&rsquo;s act, restrained all demonstration.
This was a moment for action, not for words of love;
no delay should hazard the success of their undertaking.
He heard the slight creak of the door as the girl
slipped within the concealment of the vestibule, and
then he glided away through the darkness with the
stealthy silence of an Indian. There was no one in
the alley-way, which was narrow and easily explored,
but the glow from the front windows plainly revealed
the shadow of a man near the entrance, and Keith slipped
up toward him, hugging the side of the building for
concealment, prepared to resort to harsh measures.
As he reached out, gripping the astonished loiterer
by the collar, the two stared at one another in surprise,
and the gripping hand as instantly released its hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Fairbain! What the devil does this mean?
What are you spying on us for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clearly taken aback, yet not greatly disturbed, his
eyes showing pugnacious and his jaw set, the Doctor
rubbed his throat where Keith&rsquo;s knuckles had
left a red welt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you, I think I&rsquo;m the one to ask
for an explanation,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;She
said she was not going with you, and now you are around
here together at this hour. I had a right to know
whether I was being played with like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, man, that was not Miss Maclaire I was
with; it was Hope Waite. Come back here under the
tent flap while I explain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fearful of the coming of Hawley he fairly dragged
the portly figure of the bewildered Doctor with him,
striving, by quickly spoken words, to make him comprehend
the situation. Knowing previously something of the
issues involved, it was not difficult to make Fairbain
grasp the meaning of this present movement, yet his
sympathies were at once enlisted upon the side of
Miss Christie. He&rsquo;d be damned if he would have
any part in such a scheme--if she had a right to the
money he&rsquo;d help her get it--it was a cowardly
trick, and he&rsquo;d fight if necessary, to keep her
from becoming a victim. His voice rose, his arms brandishing
violently, his sentences snapping like rifle shots.
Keith angered, and fearful of a discovery which would
leave Hope exposed, realized the futility of discussion
and turned to physical force. Grasping the gesticulating
man with both hands, he flung him backward and dragged
him into the empty tent, kneeling on him as he throttled
him to the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Doctor, you listen to me,&rdquo; he said
sternly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through arguing. I hate
to treat you like this, for you are my friend, but
I&rsquo;ll not stand for interference here. Do you
get that, you old fool? Lie still until I get through!
I respect your feelings toward Miss Maclaire. She is
a good girl, and I hope to heaven you get her if you
want her. But you never will if you permit this affair
to go on. Yes, I know what I am talking about. In
all that Hope and I do we are serving you and Christie,--our
only fight is with &lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; Hawley.
Stop being a bullet-headed old fool, Fairbain, and
understand this thing. Lie still, I tell you, and hear
me out! Hawley is a liar, a thief, and a swindler.
There is a swindle in this thing somewhere, and he
hopes to pull out a big sum of money from it. He is
merely using Christie to pull his own chestnuts out
of the fire. She is innocent; we realize that, but
this fellow is going to ruin the girl unless we succeed
in exposing him. He&rsquo;s not only involving her
in his criminal conspiracy, but he&rsquo;s making
love to her; he&rsquo;s teaching her to love him.
That&rsquo;s part of his scheme, no doubt, for then
she will be so much easier handled. I tell you, Fairbain,
your only chance to ever win the interest of Christie
Maclaire is to help us down this fellow Hawley. Yes,
you can sit up; I reckon you&rsquo;re beginning to
see clearer, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith drew aside the flap of the tent to glance without,
the light falling on Fairbain&rsquo;s face as he struggled
to a sitting posture. He had had a new thought driven
into him, yet failed to entirely grasp its significance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Jack,&rdquo; he asked, still half angry,
&ldquo;how about the girl? Hasn&rsquo;t she any right
to this money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; honestly, &ldquo;we
don&rsquo;t any of us know, but whatever she has the
right to she is going to get. You can bet on that,
old man. We&rsquo;re bucking Hawley not Christie Maclaire--get
that into your head. He hasn&rsquo;t any right, that&rsquo;s
certain, for he murdered and stole to get the papers--be
quiet! Here the fellow comes now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They peered out together through the convenient tent
flap, Fairbain scarcely less interested than the other,
already dimly comprehending that his truly dangerous
rival was the gambler, and that he could best serve
the lady by helping to prove to her the real character
of that individual. He was still blindly groping in
the haze, yet out of Keith&rsquo;s sharp, stinging
words there had come to him a guiding light. The latter
gripped his arm in restraint.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, old man, easy--let him pass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawley turned into the alley whistling, evidently
well pleased with the situation and anticipating other
delights awaiting his coming. The glow of the Trocadero&rsquo;s
lights served, an instant, to reveal his face, shaded
by the broad brim of his hat, and then he vanished
into the dark. Keith leaning far out, yet keeping
well within the shadows, heard the faint creak of
the vestibule door and the soft murmur of distant voices.
Then he drew back suddenly, his hand again grasping
Fairbain. Two figures--those of a man and woman--emerged
into the dim light, and as quickly disappeared. Apparently
her hand was upon his arm, and he was bending down
so as to gain a glimpse of the face partially concealed
by the folds of the mantilla. Only a word or two reached
them, a little laugh, and the woman&rsquo;s voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course I hurried; you said you had
something of such importance to tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fairbain,&rdquo; spoke Keith, his lips almost
at the ear of the other. &ldquo;That was Hope, all
right, and she has got him going already. Now, man,
will you help us out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go back there, and meet Miss Maclaire. I don&rsquo;t
care where you take her-- lunch, anywhere; only keep
her from the hotel as long as possible. You can do
it far better than I, for she will not suspect you
of any interest in this affair. Tell her any lie you
can think up on account of Hawley&rsquo;s absence.
Good Lord, old man, can&rsquo;t you see this is your
chance; go in and win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairbain struggled to his feet, still a bit dazed
and uncertain, yet tempted by the opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly sure, Keith, this isn&rsquo;t
anything that will hurt the girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! Of course I am. It&rsquo;s just Hawley
I&rsquo;m gunning after. For God&rsquo;s sake, haven&rsquo;t
you got that clear yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I--I reckon I&rsquo;m an old fool, Jack,&rdquo;
admitted the Doctor regretfully, &ldquo;and when an
old fool is in love he hasn&rsquo;t got any sense left.
Anyhow I&rsquo;ll do what you want me to now. Where
are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To watch those others. There is no knowing
what play Hawley might try to pull off, and I want
to keep within gun-shot of him. Hurry up, man; that
vestibule door creaked just then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shoved him down the dark alley, and dodged back
himself across the front of the tent out into the
street. There was a crowd of men in front of the Trocadero,
but the couple he sought were nowhere in sight.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXIX"></a>Chapter XXIX</h1>

<h2>By Force of Arms</h2>

<p>With her heart throbbing fiercely, Hope clung to the
outer door of the vestibule endeavoring to see a little
of what was transpiring without. About her was dense
darkness, and she dare not explore the surroundings.
Behind could be heard, through what must have been
a thin partition, the various distractions of the
stage, shifting scenery, music, shuffling feet, voices,
and the occasional sound of applause. The girl had
nerved herself to the encounter with Hawley but this
waiting here in darkness and uncertainty tried her
to the uttermost. If some one should venture out that
way how could she excuse her presence or explain her
purpose? She found herself trembling in every limb
from nervous fear, startled by every strange sound.
Would the man never come? Surely Christie herself must
be ready to depart by this time.</p>

<p>Almost prepared to flee before the terrors thus conjured
up within her mind, they left her as if by magic the
moment her straining eyes distinguished the approach
of a dim figure without. She could not tell who it
was, only that it was the unmistakable form of a man,
and that he was whistling softly to himself. It might
not prove to be the gambler, but she must accept the
chance, for flesh and blood could stand the strain
of waiting no longer. Yet she was not conscious of
fear, only of exultation, as she stepped forth into
the open, her blood again circulating freely in her
veins. At the slight creak of the door the man saw
her, his whistle ceasing, his hat lifted. Instantly
she recognized him as Hawley, her heart leaping with
the excitement of encounter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, hullo, Christie,&rdquo; he said familiarly,
&ldquo;I thought I was early, and expected a ten minutes&rsquo;
wait. I came out as soon as you left the stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can dress in a jiffy when there is any
cause for hurry,&rdquo; Hope responded, permitting
herself to drift under his guidance. &ldquo;Are you
disappointed? Would you prefer to commune with nature?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should say not,&rdquo; drawing her
hand through his arm, and then patting it with his
own. &ldquo;I have seen about all I care to of nature,
but not of Christie Maclaire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may learn to feel the same regarding her,&rdquo;
Hope answered, afraid to encourage the man, yet eagerly
fearful lest she fail to play her part aright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest danger,&rdquo; laughing lightly,
and pressing her arm more closely against his body.
&ldquo;Although I must confess you exhibited some
temper when I was late to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I not have occasion to? A woman should
never be kept waiting, especially if her engagement
be imperative.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not finding any fault, you little
spitfire. I like you all the better because you fight.
But the trouble was, Christie, you simply jumped on
me without even asking how it occurred. You took it
for granted I was late on purpose to spite you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and the girl
glanced inquiringly up into his face, as they passed
out of the alley into the light of the Trocadero&rsquo;s
windows. &ldquo;You certainly acted that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I did not; but you wouldn&rsquo;t listen,
and besides I had no time then to explain. There&rsquo;s
a lot happened this afternoon I want to tell you about.
Will you give me time to talk with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; surprised at the question,
yet full of eagerness. &ldquo;Why should you ask that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I want you alone where no one can overhear
a syllable. I&rsquo;m afraid of that damned hotel.
You never know who is in the next room, and the slightest
whisper travels from one end to the other. That is
one way in which Keith got onto our deal--he had a
room next to Willoughby and Scott, and overheard them
talking. I&rsquo;m not going to take any more chances.
Will you go to &lsquo;Sheeny Joe&rsquo;s&rsquo; with
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She drew back from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sheeny Joe&rsquo;s&rsquo;? You mean
the saloon near the depot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure; what&rsquo;s the use of being so squeamish?
You sing and dance to a saloon crowd, don&rsquo;t
you? Oh, I know you&rsquo;re a good girl, Christie,
and all that. I&rsquo;m not ranking you with these
fly-by-nights around here. But there&rsquo;s no reason
that I can see why you should shy so at a saloon.
Besides, you won&rsquo;t see any one. Joe has got some
back rooms where we can be alone, and have a bite
to eat while we&rsquo;re talking. What do you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I would rather not,&rdquo; Hope faltered,
bewildered by this unexpected request, already half-tempted
to break away and run. &ldquo;Really I--I don&rsquo;t
want to go there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawley was evidently surprised at this refusal, naturally
supposing from her life that Miss Maclaire&rsquo;s
scruples would be easily overcome. This obstinacy
of the girl aroused his anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You women beat the devil,&rdquo; he ejaculated,
gruffly, &ldquo;pretending to be so damn particular.
Maybe you&rsquo;d rather stand out there on the prairie
and talk?&rdquo; with a sweep of his hand around the
horizon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would,&rdquo; catching desperately at
the straw. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of you; I&rsquo;m
not blaming you at all, only I--I don&rsquo;t want
to go to &lsquo;Sheeny Joe&rsquo;s.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her, puzzled at her attitude, and yet
somewhat reassured by her expression of confidence.
Oh, well, what was the difference? It might be better
to let her have her own way, and the change would not
materially interfere with his plans. Of course, it
would be pleasanter sitting together at one of Joe&rsquo;s
tables, but he could talk just as freely out yonder
under the stars. Besides, it might be as well now to
humor the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, Christie,&rdquo; his voice regaining
its pleasant tone. &ldquo;You shall have your way
this time. There is too much at stake for us to quarrel
over this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frightened, yet not daring to resist or exhibit the
least reluctance, she clung to his arm, and permitted
him to lead her to the right down a dark passage and
out into the open land beyond. He had to feel his way
carefully, and scarcely spoke, yet proceeded as though
the passage was reasonably familiar and he had some
definite point in view. She answered in monosyllables,
now thoroughly regretful of having permitted herself
to drift into this position, yet not in the least
knowing how to extricate herself. Hawley took everything
for granted, her very silence convincing him of her
acquiescence. With throbbing pulse, Hope felt the small
revolver hidden within her dress, undoing a button
so that, in emergency, she might grasp it more quickly.
Hawley felt the movement, the trembling of her arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are afraid, just the same,&rdquo; he said,
pressing her to him lover-like. &ldquo;Darkness always
gets on a woman&rsquo;s nerves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that and loneliness,&rdquo; resenting
his familiarity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do we need to go any farther? Surely, we are
alone here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a few steps; the ravine is yonder, and
we can sit down on the rocks. I want to smoke, and
we will be entirely out of sight there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He helped her down the rather sharp declivity until
both were thoroughly concealed below the prairie level.
Feeling about with his hands he found the surface
of a smooth rock, and seated her upon it. Then a match
flared, casting an instant&rsquo;s gleam across his
face as he lighted his cigar. Blacker than ever the
night shut down about them, and he groped for a seat
beside her. She could perceive just one star peering
through a rift of cloud, and in her nostrils was the
pungent odor of tobacco. With a little shiver of disgust
she drew slightly away from him, dreading what was
to come. One thing alone she felt was in her favor--however
familiar Hawley attempted to be, he was evidently
not yet sufficiently sure of Miss Maclaire to become
entirely offensive. She might not have frowned at his
love-making, but apparently he had not yet progressed
sufficiently far in her good graces to venture to
extremes. Hope pressed her lips together, determined
to resist any further approach of the man. However,
his earliest words were a relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon, Christie,&rdquo; he said slowly,
between puffs on his cigar, the lighted end of which
faintly illumined his face, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
the idea I have brought you out here to make love.
Lord knows I&rsquo;d like to well enough, but just
now there&rsquo;s more important matters on hand. Fact
is, my girl, we&rsquo;re up against a little back-set,
and have got to make a shift in our plans--a mighty
quick shift, too,&rdquo; he added, almost savagely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I--I don&rsquo;t think I understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course, you don&rsquo;t. You imagine
all we&rsquo;ve got to do in a matter of this kind
is to step into the nearest court, and draw the money.
One trouble is, our evidence isn&rsquo;t complete--we&rsquo;ve
got to find that woman who brought you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Hope, not knowing what else
to say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, apparently satisfied
with her exclamation. &ldquo;Of course, I know she&rsquo;s
dead, or at least, you say so, but we haven&rsquo;t
got enough proof without her--not the way old Waite
promises to fight your claim--and so we&rsquo;ve got
to hunt for a substitute. Do you happen to know any
old woman about the right age who would make affidavit
for you? She probably wouldn&rsquo;t have to go on
the stand at all. Waite will cave in as soon as he
knows we&rsquo;ve got the evidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited for an answer, but she hardly knew what
to say. Then she remembered that Keith insisted that
Miss Maclaire had no conception that there was any
fraud in her claim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I know no one. But what do you mean? I
thought everything was straight? That there was no
question about my right to inherit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there isn&rsquo;t, Christie,&rdquo; pulling
fiercely on his cigar. &ldquo;But the courts are particular;
they have got to have the whole thing in black and
white. I thought all along I could settle the entire
matter with Waite outside, but the old fool won&rsquo;t
listen to reason. I saw him twice to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twice?&rdquo; surprise wringing the word from
her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; thought I had got him off on a false scent
and out of the way, the first time, but he turned
up again like a bad penny. What&rsquo;s worse, he&rsquo;s
evidently stumbled on to a bit of legal information
which makes it safer for us to disappear until we
can get the links of our chain forged. He&rsquo;s
taken the case into court already, and the sheriff
is here tryin&rsquo; to find me so as to serve the
papers. I&rsquo;ve got to skip out, and so&rsquo;ve
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; rising to her feet, indignantly.
&ldquo;What have I done to be frightened over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed, but not pleasantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell, Christie, can&rsquo;t you understand?
Old Waite is after you the same way he is me. It&rsquo;ll
knock our whole case if he can get you into court
before our evidence is ready. All you know is what
I have told you--that&rsquo;s straight enough--but
we&rsquo;ve got to have proof. I can get it in a month,
but he&rsquo;s got hold of something which gives him
a leverage. I don&rsquo;t know what it is--maybe it&rsquo;s
just a bluff--but the charge is conspiracy, and he&rsquo;s
got warrants out. There is nothing for us to do but
skip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But my clothes; my engagement?&rdquo; she urged,
feeling the insistent earnestness of the man, and
sparring for delay. &ldquo;Why, I cannot go. Besides,
if the sheriff is hunting us, the trains will be watched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I am fool enough to risk the
trains?&rdquo; he exclaimed, roughly, plainly losing
patience. &ldquo;Not much; horses and the open plains
for us, and a good night the start of them. They will
search for me first, and you&rsquo;ll never be missed
until you fail to show up at the Trocadero. Never
mind the clothes; they can be sent after us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night!&rdquo; she cried, awakening to the
immediate danger, and rising to her feet. &ldquo;You
urge me to fly with you to-night?--now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, don&rsquo;t be foolish and kick up a
row. The horses are here waiting just around the end
of the ravine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She pressed her hands to her breast, shrinking away
from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! No! I will not go!&rdquo; she declared,
indignantly. &ldquo;Keep back! Don&rsquo;t touch me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hawley must have expected the resistance, for with
a single movement he grasped her even as she turned
to fly, pinning her arms helplessly to her side, holding
her as in a vice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you will, my beauty,&rdquo; he growled.
&ldquo;I thought you might act up and I&rsquo;m ready.
Do you think I am fool enough to leave you here alone
to be pumped dry? It is a big stake I&rsquo;m playing
after, girl, and I am not going to lose it through
the whims of a woman. If you won&rsquo;t go pleasantly,
then you&rsquo;ll go by force. Keep still, you tigress!
Do you want me to choke you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She struggled to break loose, twisting and turning,
but the effort was useless. Suddenly he whistled sharply.
There was the sound of feet scrambling down the path,
and the frightened woman perceived the dim outlines
of several approaching men. She gave one scream, and
Hawley released his grip on her arms to grasp her
throat.</p>

<p>She jerked away, half-stumbling backward over a rock.
The revolver, carried concealed in her dress, was
in her hand. Mad with terror, scarcely knowing what
she did, she pulled the trigger. In the flash she saw
one man throw up his hands and go down. The next instant
the others were upon her.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXX"></a>Chapter XXX</h1>

<h2>In Christie&rsquo;s Room</h2>

<p>Keith swept his glance up and down the street without
results. Surely, Hawley and his companion could not
have disappeared so suddenly. They had turned to the
right, he was certain as to that, and he pushed through
the crowd of men around the theatre entrance, and
hastened to overtake them. He found nothing to overtake--nowhere
along that stretch of street, illumined by window
lights, was there any sign of a man and woman walking
together. He stopped bewildered, staring blindly about,
failing utterly to comprehend this mysterious vanishing.
What could it mean? What had happened? How could they
have disappeared so completely during that single
moment he had waited to speak to Fairbain? The man&rsquo;s
heart beat like a trip-hammer with apprehension, a
sudden fear for Hope taking possession of him. Surely
the girl would never consent to enter any of those
dens along the way, and Hawley would not dare resort
to force in the open street. The very thought seemed
preposterous, and yet, with no other supposition possible,
he entered these one after the other in hasty search,
questioning the inmates sharply, only to find himself
totally baffled-- Hawley and Hope had vanished as
though swallowed by the earth. He explored dark passage-ways
between the scattered buildings, rummaging about recklessly,
but came back to the street again without reward.</p>

<p>Could they have gone down the other side, in the deeper
shadows, and thus reached the hotel more quickly than
it seemed to him possible? There was hardly a chance
that this could be true, and yet Keith grasped at it
desperately, cursing himself for having wasted time.
Five minutes later, breathless, almost speechless
with anxiety, he startled the clerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has Miss Waite come in? Miss Hope Waite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blamed if I know,&rdquo; retorted the other,
indifferently. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t for the life of
me tell those two females apart. One of them passed
through &rsquo;bout ten minutes ago; Doc Fairbain
was with her. Another party just went upstairs hunting
Miss Maclaire, and as they haven&rsquo;t come down,
I reckon it must have been her--anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure yet,&rdquo; shortly. &ldquo;Who
was this other person?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old fellow with white hair and whiskers--swore
like a pirate--had the sheriff along with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It came to Keith in a flash--it was Waite. Perhaps
Christie knew. Perhaps the General knew. Certainly
something of importance was crystallizing in the actress&rsquo;
room which might help to explain all else. He rushed
up the stairs, barely waiting to rap once at the closed
door before he pressed it open. The sight within held
him silent, waiting opportunity to blurt out his news.
Here, also, was tragedy, intense, compelling, which
for the instant seemed to even overshadow the fate
of the girl he loved. There were three men present,
and the woman. She stood clutching the back of a chair,
white-faced and open-eyed, with Fairbain slightly behind
her, one hand grasping her arm, the other clinched,
his jaw set pugnaciously. Facing these two was Waite,
and a heavily built man wearing a brown beard, closely
trimmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better acknowledge it,&rdquo; Waite
snapped out, with a quick glance at the newcomer.
&ldquo;It will make it all the easier for you. I tell
you this is the sheriff, and we&rsquo;ve got you both
dead to rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;why should I
be arrested? I have done nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an adventuress--a damn adventuress--Hawley&rsquo;s
mistress, probably-- a--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, see here, Waite,&rdquo; and Fairbain swung
himself forward, &ldquo;you drop that. Miss Maclaire
is my friend, and if you say another word I&rsquo;ll
smash you, sheriff or no sheriff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waite glared at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You old fool,&rdquo; he snorted, &ldquo;what
have you got to do with this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got this to do with it, you&rsquo;ll
find--the woman is to be treated with respect or I&rsquo;ll
blow your damned obstinate head off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sheriff laid his hand on Waite&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, firmly, &ldquo;this is
no way to get at it. We want to know certain facts,
and then we can proceed lawfully. Let me question the
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two older men still faced one another belligerently,
but Keith saw Christie draw the doctor back from between
her and the sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may ask me anything you please,&rdquo;
she announced, quietly. &ldquo;I am sure these gentlemen
will not fight here in my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Miss Maclaire. It will require only
a moment. How long have you known this man Hawley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely a few days--since I arrived in Sheridan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you were in communication with him before
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pleasant voice and quiet demeanor of the sheriff
seemed to yield the girl confidence and courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, he had written me two or three letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You met him here then by appointment?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was to come to Sheridan, and explain to
me more fully what his letters had only hinted at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You possessed no previous knowledge of his
purpose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only the barest outline--details were given
me later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you tell us briefly exactly what Hawley
told you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s bewildered eyes wandered from face
to face, then returned to the waiting sheriff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May--may I sit down?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most certainly; and don&rsquo;t be afraid,
for really we wish to be your friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She sank down into the chair, and even Keith could
see how her slender form trembled. There was a moment&rsquo;s
silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe me, gentlemen,&rdquo; she began, falteringly,
&ldquo;if there is any fraud, any conspiracy, I have
borne no conscious part in it. Mr. Hawley came to
me saying a dying man had left with him certain papers,
naming one, Phyllis Gale, as heiress to a very large
estate in North Carolina, left by her grandfather
in trust. He said the girl had been taken West, when
scarcely two years old, by her father in a fit of drunken
rage, and then deserted by him in St. Louis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You--you saw the papers?&rdquo; Waite broke
in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, those that Hawley had; he gave them to
me to keep for him.&rdquo; She crossed to her trunk,
and came back, a manilla envelope in her hand. Waite
opened it hastily, running his eyes over the contents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The infernal scoundrel!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
hotly. &ldquo;These were stolen from me at Carson
City.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see them.&rdquo; The sheriff ran them
over, merely glancing at the endorsements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just as you represented, Waite,&rdquo; he said,
slowly. &ldquo;A copy of the will, your commission
as guardian, and memoranda of identification. Well,
Miss Maclaire, how did you happen to be so easily
convinced that you were the lost girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawley brought me a picture which he said
was of this girl&rsquo;s half-sister; the resemblance
was most startling. This, with the fact that I have
never known either father or mother or my real name,
and that my earlier life was passed in St. Louis,
sufficed to make me believe he must be right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You--you--&rdquo; Waite choked, leaning forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know your real name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; her lips barely forming
the words. &ldquo;The woman who brought me up never
told me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who--who was the woman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Mrs. Raymond--Sue Raymond--she was on the
stage, and died in Texas--San Antonio, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waite swore audibly, his eyes never once deserting
the girl&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawley told you to say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he did not,&rdquo; she protested warmly.
&ldquo;It was never even mentioned between us--at
least, not Sue Raymond&rsquo;s name. What difference
can that make?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped forward, one hand flung out, and Fairbain
sprang forward instantly between them, mistaking the
action.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hands off there, Waite,&rdquo; he commanded
sternly. &ldquo;Whatever she says goes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You blundering old idiot,&rdquo; the other
exploded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt her;
stand aside, will you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached the startled girl, thrust aside the dark
hair combed low over the neck, swung her about toward
the light, and stared at a birthmark behind her ear.
No one spoke, old Waite seemingly stricken dumb, the
woman shrinking away from him as though she feared
he was crazed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the sheriff, sternly.</p>

<p>Slowly Waite turned about and faced him, running the
sleeve of his coat across his eyes. He appeared dazed,
confounded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said,
with a choke in the throat. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s-- she&rsquo;s
the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Christie stared at him, her lips parted, unable to
grasp what it all meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean I--I am actually Phyllis Gale? That--that
there is no mistake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He nodded, not yet able to put It more clearly into
words. She swayed as though about to faint, and Fairbain
caught her, but she slipped through his arms, and
fell upon her knees, her face buried in her hands upon
the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank God,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;thank
God! I know who I am! I know who I am!&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXXI"></a>Chapter XXXI</h1>

<h2>The Search for the Missing</h2>

<p>The note of unrestrained joy of relief in the woman&rsquo;s
voice rang through the room, stilling all else, and
causing those who heard to forget for an instant the
sterner purpose of their gathering. Fairbain bent over
her, like a fat guardian angel, patting her shoulder,
her eyes so blurred with tears as to be practically
sightless, yet still turned questioningly upon Waite.
The sheriff was first to recover speech, and a sense
of duty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then this lets Miss Maclaire out of the conspiracy
charge,&rdquo; he said, gravely, &ldquo;but it doesn&rsquo;t
make it any brighter for Hawley so far as I can see--there&rsquo;s
a robbery charge against him if nothing else. Any one
here know where the fellow is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment no one answered, although Keith took
a step forward, reminded instantly of Hope&rsquo;s
predicament. Before he could speak, however, Christie
looked up, with swift gesture pushing back her loosened
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was to have met me at the theatre to-night,&rdquo;
she said, her voice trembling, &ldquo;but was not
there when I came out; he--he said he had important
news for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And failed to show up--did he send no message?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor Fairbain was waiting for me instead.
He said that Mr. Hawley was called suddenly out of
town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eyes of the sheriff turned to Fairbain, whose
face grew redder than usual, as he shifted his gaze
toward Keith.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a lie,&rdquo; he confessed, lamely.
&ldquo;I--I was told to say that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Sheriff,&rdquo; and Keith stood
before them, his voice clear and convincing. &ldquo;My
name is Keith, and I have unavoidably been mixed up
in this affair from the beginning. Just now I can
relieve the doctor of his embarrassment. Miss Hope
Waite and I have been associated together in an effort
to solve this mystery. This evening, taking advantage
of the remarkable resemblance existing between herself
and Miss Maclaire, Miss Hope decided upon a mask--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that,&rdquo; Waite broke in excitedly.
&ldquo;Is Hope here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, has been for a week; we&rsquo;ve had all
the police force of Sheridan hunting you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man stared at the speaker, open-mouthed, and
muttered something about Fort Hays, but Keith, paying
little attention to him, hurried on with his story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I say, she decided upon impersonating Christie
here, hoping in this way to learn more regarding Hawley&rsquo;s
plans. We had discovered that the two were to meet
after the evening performance at the stage door of
the Trocadero. I escorted Hope there, dressed as near
like Miss Maclaire as possible, and left her inside
the vestibule waiting for &lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo;
to appear. At the head of the alley I ran into Fairbain,
told him something of the circumstances, and persuaded
him to escort Miss Christie back to the hotel. He
was not very hard to persuade. Well, Hawley came, and
Hope met him; they went out of the alley-way together
arm in arm, talking pleasantly, and turned this way
toward the hotel. The doctor and I both saw and heard
them. I was delayed not to exceed two minutes, speaking
a final word to Fairbain, and when I reached the street
they had disappeared. I have hunted them everywhere
without finding a trace--I have even been through
the resorts. She has not returned to the hotel, and
I burst in upon you here hoping that Miss Maclaire
might have some information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head, and Waite, glaring impotently
at the two of them, swore sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God, man! my girl! Hope, alone with that
damn villain. Come on, Sheriff; we&rsquo;ve got to
find her. Wait though!&rdquo; and he strode almost
menacingly across the room. &ldquo;First, I want to
know who the devil you are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith straightened up, looking directly into the fierce
questioning eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you my name--Jack Keith,&rdquo;
he replied, quietly. &ldquo;Doctor Fairbain knows
something of me, but for your further information I
will add that when we met before I was Captain Keith,
Third Virginia Cavalry, and bearing despatches from
Longstreet to Stonewall Jackson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gruff old soldier, half-crazed by the news of
his daughter&rsquo;s peril, the gleam of his eyes
still revealing uncontrolled temper, stared at the
younger face fronting him; then slowly he held out
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keith--Keith,&rdquo; he repeated, as though
bringing back the name with an effort. &ldquo;By God,
that&rsquo;s so--old Jefferson Keith&rsquo;s boy--killed
at Antietam. And you know Hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, General.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked about as though dazed, and the sheriff broke
in not unkindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Waite, if we are going to search for
your daughter we better be at it. Come on, all of
you; Miss Maclaire will be safe enough here alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took hold of Keith&rsquo;s arm, questioning him
briefly as they passed down the hall. On the stairs
the latter took his turn, still confused by what he
had just heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is Miss Maclaire?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phyllis Gale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, but who is Phyllis Gale? What has
she to do with General Waite? His daughter has told
me she never heard of any one by that name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Keith, the old man has never told me
very much; he&rsquo;s pretty close-mouthed, except
for swearing, but I&rsquo;ve read his papers, and picked
up a point or two. I reckon the daughter, Miss Hope,
maybe never heard a word about it, but the boy--the
one that was shot--must have stumbled onto the story
and repeated it to Hawley. That&rsquo;s what set that
fellow going. It seems Mrs. Waite&rsquo;s maiden name
was Pierpont, and when she was seventeen years old
she was married to the son of a rich North Carolina
planter. The fellow was a drunken, dissolute good-for-nothing.
They had a daughter born--this Phyllis--and when the
child was three years old her father, in a fit of
drunken rage, ran away, and to spite his wife took
the little girl with him. All efforts to trace them
failed, and the mother finally secured a divorce and,
two years later, married Willis Waite. Waite, of course,
knew these facts, but probably they were never told
to the children. When the father of Mrs. Waite&rsquo;s
first husband died, he left all his large property
to his grandchild, providing she could be found and
identified within a certain time, failing which the
property was to be distributed among certain designated
charities. Waite was named sole administrator. Well,
the old man took as much interest in it as though it
was his own girl, but made mighty little progress.
He did discover that the father had taken the child
to St. Louis and left her there with a woman named
Raymond, but after the woman died the girl completely
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then Miss Maclaire is Hope Waite&rsquo;s half-sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it looks now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Hawley merely happened to stumble on to
the right party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure; it&rsquo;s clear enough how that came
about. The boy told him about the lost heiress his
father was searching after, and showed him his sister&rsquo;s
picture. &lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; instantly recognized
her resemblance to Christie Maclaire, and thought
he saw a good chance for some easy money. He needed
the papers, however, to ascertain exactly the terms
of the will, and what would be necessary for the identification.
He never intended to go into court, but hoped to either
get Waite out of the way, or else convince him that
Christie was the girl, relying on her gratitude for
his profits. When Waite played into his hands by coming
to Carson City, the chance was too good to be lost.
I&rsquo;m not sure he meant to kill him, but he did
mean to have those papers at any cost. Probably you
know the rest--the girl was easy, because she was
so ignorant of her parentage, and nothing prevented
Hawley from winning except that Waite got mad and decided
to fight. That knocked over the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were outside now, and the first touch of the
cool night air, the first glance up and down the noisy
street, brought Keith to himself, his mind ready to
grapple with the problem of Hope&rsquo;s disappearance.
It seemed to him he had already looked everywhere,
yet there was nothing to do except to continue the
search, only more systematically. The sheriff assumed
control--clear headed, and accustomed to that sort
of thing-- calling in Hickock and his deputies to
assist, and fairly combing the town from one end to
the other. Not a rat could have slipped unobserved
through the net he dragged down that long street,
or its intersecting alleys--but  it was without result;
nowhere was there found a trace of either the gambler
or his companion.</p>

<p>They dug into saloons, bagnios, dance-halls, searching
back rooms and questioning inmates; they routed out
every occupant of the hotel, invaded boarding houses,
and explored shacks and tents, indifferent to the
protests of those disturbed,--but without result. They
found several who knew Hawley, others who had seen
the two together passing by the lighted windows of
the Trocadero, but beyond that--nothing. Convinced,
at last, that the parties sought were not alive in
Sheridan, and beginning to fear the worst, the searchers
separated, and began spreading forth over the black
surrounding prairie, and by the light of lanterns seeking
any semblance of trail. There was no lack of volunteers
for this work, but it was daylight before the slightest
clue presented itself. Keith, with the sheriff and
two or three others, had groped their way outward until,
with the first flush of dawn, they found themselves
at the opening of a small rocky ravine, near the foot
of &ldquo;Boots Hill.&rdquo; Peering down into its
still shadowed depths, they discerned what appeared
like a body lying there motionless. Keith sprang down
beside it, and turned the rigid form over until the
dead face was revealed in the wan light--it was that
of the red moustached Scott. He staggered back at
the recognition, barely able to ejaculate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, Sheriff! This is one of Hawley&rsquo;s
men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sheriff was bending instantly above the corpse,
searching for the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, his name was Scott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s been dead some hours, at least
six I should say; shot just above the eye, and good
Heavens! look here, Keith, at the size of this bullet
wound; that&rsquo;s no man&rsquo;s gun in this country--no
more than a &lsquo;32&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Waite had a small revolver. She must have
shot the fellow. But why did they leave the body here
to be discovered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sheriff arose to his feet, prowling about in the
brightening glow of the dawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were in a hurry to get away, and knew
he wouldn&rsquo;t be found before morning. A six hours&rsquo;
start means a good deal. They did drag him back out
of sight--look here. This was where the struggle took
place, and here is where the man fell,&rdquo; tracing
it out upon the ground. &ldquo;The girl put up a stiff
fight, too--see where they dragged her up the path.
From the footprints there must have been half a dozen
in the party. Get back out of the way, Sims, while
I follow their trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was plain enough, now they had daylight to assist
them, and led around the edge of the hill. A hundred
feet away they came to where horses had been standing,
the trampled sod evidencing they must have been there
for some considerable time. Keith and the sheriff
circled out until they finally struck the trail of
the party, which led forth southwest across the prairie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seven horses, one being led light,&rdquo; said
the former. &ldquo;That was Scott&rsquo;s, probably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the whole story,&rdquo; replied
the sheriff, staring off toward the bare horizon,
&ldquo;and the cusses have at least six hours the start
with fresh horses.&rdquo; He turned around. &ldquo;Well,
boys, that takes &rsquo;em out of my baliwick, I reckon.
Some of the rest of you will have to run that gang
down.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Fairbain and Christie</h2>

<p>Dr. Fairbain had originally joined the searching party,
fully as eager as Keith himself to run down the renegade
Hawley, but after an hour of resultless effort, his
entire thought shifted to the woman they had left
alone at the hotel. He could not, as yet, fully grasp
the situation, but he remained loyal to the one overpowering
truth that he loved Christie Maclaire. Fairbain&rsquo;s
nature was rough, original, yet loyal to the core.
He had lived all his life long in army camps, and
upon the frontier, and his code of honor was extremely
simple. It never once occurred to him that Christie&rsquo;s
profession was not of the highest, or that her life
and associations in any way unfitted her for the future.
To his mind she was the one and only woman. His last
memory of her, as the little party of men filed out
of that room, haunted him until he finally dropped
out of the search, and drifted back toward the hotel.</p>

<p>It was a late hour, yet it was hardly likely the woman
had retired. Her excitement, her interest in the pursuit,
would surely prevent that; moreover, he was certain
he saw a light still burning in her room, as he looked
up from the black street below. Nevertheless he hesitated,
uncertain of his reception. Bluff, emphatic, never
afraid to face a man in his life, his heart now beat
fiercely as he endeavored to muster the necessary
courage. Far down the dark street some roysterer fired
a shot, and sudden fear lest he might be sought after
professionally sent the doctor hurriedly within, and
up the stairs. He stood, just outside her door, quaking
like a child, the perspiration beading his forehead,
but a light streamed through the transom, and he could
plainly hear movements within. At last, in a sudden
spasm of courage, he knocked softly. Even in that
noisy spot she heard instantly, opening the door without
hesitation, and standing fully dressed within. She
was no longer a discouraged, sobbing girl, but an
aroused, intent woman, into whose pathetic, lonely
life there had come a new hope. She appeared younger,
fairer, with the light shimmering in her hair and
her eyes smiling welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doctor,&rdquo; and her hands were thrust
out towards him, &ldquo;I am glad you have come. Somehow,
I thought you would, and I have wanted so to talk to
someone--to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To me! Do you really mean that, Miss Christie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I really mean that, you great bear of
a man,&rdquo; and the girl laughed lightly, dragging
him into the room, and closing the door. &ldquo;Why,
who else could I expect to come to-night? You were
the only one really good to me. You--you acted as
if you believed in me all the time--&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, Christie; you bet I did,&rdquo; broke
in the delighted doctor, every nerve tingling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
&lsquo;a&rsquo; cleaned out that whole gang if you&rsquo;d
only said so, but I reckon now it was better to let
them tell all they knew. It was like a thunder storm
clearing the atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was, indeed! Now I know who I am--who
I am! Isn&rsquo;t that simply glorious? Sit down,
Doctor Fairbain, there in the big chair where I can
see your face. I want to talk, talk, talk; I want to
ask questions, a thousand questions; but it wouldn&rsquo;t
do any good to ask them of you, would it? You don&rsquo;t
know anything about my family, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not very much, I am afraid, only that you have
got an almighty pretty half-sister,&rdquo; admitted
the man, emphatically, &ldquo;and old Waite possesses
the vilest temper ever given a human being. He&rsquo;s
no blood kin to you, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but he is awfully good underneath, isn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got a heart of pure gold, old Waite. Why, I&rsquo;ve
seen him cry like a baby over one of his men that
got hurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you known him, then, for a long while?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since the Spring of &rsquo;61. I was brigaded
with him all through the war, and had to cut a bullet
or so out of his hide before it ended. If there was
ever a fight, Willis Waite was sure to get his share.
He could swear some then, but he&rsquo;s improved
since, and I reckon now he could likely claim the
championship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did--did you know my mother also?&rdquo; and
Christie leaned forward, her eyes suddenly grown misty.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even the slightest memory of
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s heart was tender, and he was swift
to respond, reaching forth and grasping the hand nearest
him. He had made love before, yet somehow this was
different; he felt half afraid of this woman, and it
was a new sensation altogether, and not unpleasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw her often enough in those days, but not
since. She was frequently in camp, a very sweet-faced
woman; you have her eyes and hair, as I remember.
Waite ought to have recognized you at first sight.
By Heavens! that was what made me so internally mad,
the mulish obstinacy of the old fool. Your mother
used to come to the hospital tent, too; one of the
best nurses I ever saw. I thought she was a beauty
then, but she&rsquo;s some older by this time,&rdquo;
he paused regretfully. &ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m no
spring chicken, myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her eyes were upon his face, a slight flush showing
in either cheek, and she made no effort to withdraw
her imprisoned hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are just a nice age,&rdquo; with firm conviction.
&ldquo;Boys are tiresome, and I think a little gray
in the hair is an improvement. Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t
imagine I say this just to please you--I have always
thought so, since--well, since I grew up. Besides,
fleshy men generally look young, because they are
so good natured, perhaps. How old are you, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the gray hairs I mind, either,&rdquo;
he admitted hesitatingly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m too
darned bald-headed. Oh, I ain&rsquo;t so old, for I
was only thirty-five when the war broke out. I was
so thin then I could hardly cast a shadow. I&rsquo;ve
changed some since,&rdquo; casting his eyes admiringly
downward, &ldquo;and got quite a figure. I was forty-three
last month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t old; that&rsquo;s just right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been afraid you looked on me as
being an old fogy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;Why
should you ever think that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there were so many young fellows hanging
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Keith, and Hawley, and that bunch of officers
from the fort; you never had any time to give me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She laughed again, her fingers tightening in their
clasp on his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how foolish; Hawley is older than you
are, and I was only playing with Keith. Surely you
must know that now. And as to the officers, they were
just fun. You see, in my profession, one has to be
awfully nice to everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you really care for Hawley?&rdquo;
he insisted, bluntly probing for facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He--he interested me,&rdquo; admitted the girl,
hesitatingly, her eyes darkening with sudden anger.
&ldquo;He lied and I believed him--I would have believed
any one who came with such a story. Oh, Dr. Fairbain,&rdquo;
and she clung to him now eagerly, &ldquo;you cannot
realize how hungry I have been for what he brought
me. I wanted so to know the truth of my birth. Oh,
I hated this life!&rdquo; She flung her disengaged
hand into the air, with a gesture expressive of disgust.
&ldquo;I was crazy to get away from it. That was what
made the man look good to me--he--he promised so much.
You will believe me, won&rsquo;t you? Oh, you must;
I am going to make you. I am a singer in music halls;
I was brought up to that life from a little girl, and
of course, I know what you Western men think of us
as a class. Hawley showed it in his whole manner toward
me, and I resented it; just for that, deep down in
my heart, I hated him. I know it now, now that I really
understand his purpose; but some way, when I was with
him he seemed to fascinate me, to make me do just
as he willed. But you have never been that way; you--you have acted as though I was somebody--somebody nice,
and not just a music-hall singer. Perhaps it&rsquo;s
just your way, and maybe, deep down you don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m any better than the others do, but--but
I want you to think I am, and I am going to tell you
the truth, and you must believe me --I am a good girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great God! of course you are,&rdquo; he blurted
out. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose I know? That isn&rsquo;t
what has been bothering me, lassie. Why, I&rsquo;d
&lsquo;a&rsquo; fought any buck who&rsquo;d &lsquo;a&rsquo;
sneered at you. What I wanted to know was, whether
or not you really cared for any of those duffers.
Can you tell me that, Christie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She lifted her eyes to his face, her lips parted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can answer any thing you ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you do not care for them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew his breath sharply, his round face rosy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you have got to listen to me, for I&rsquo;m
deadly in earnest. I&rsquo;m an old, rough, bald-headed
fool that don&rsquo;t know much about women,--I never
thought before I&rsquo;d ever want to,--but you can
bet on one thing, I&rsquo;m square. Anybody in this
town will tell you I&rsquo;m square. They&rsquo;ll
tell you that whatever I say goes. I&rsquo;ve never
run around much with women; somehow I never exactly
liked the kind I&rsquo;ve come up against, and maybe
they didn&rsquo;t feel any particular interest in
me. I didn&rsquo;t cut much shine as a ladies&rsquo;
man, but, I reckon now, it&rsquo;s only because the
right one hadn&rsquo;t happened along. She is here
now, though, all right, and I knew it the very first
time I set eyes on her. Oh, you roped and tied me all
right the first throw. Maybe I did get you and that
half-sister mixed up a bit, but just the same you
were the one I really wanted. Hope&rsquo;s all right;
she&rsquo;s a mighty fine girl, but you are the one
for me, Christie. Could you--could you care for such
a duffer as I am?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her lips were smiling and so were her eyes, but it
was a pleading smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I--I don&rsquo;t think it would be so very
hard,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;not if you really
wanted me to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what I mean--that I love you,--wish
you to be my wife?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I supposed that was it--that--that you wanted
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and--and you will love me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her head drooped slowly, so slowly he did not realize
the significance of the action, until her lips touched
his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are the best
man in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairbain could not move, could not seem to realize
what it all meant. The outcome had been so sudden,
so surprising, that all power of expression deserted
him. In bewilderment he lifted her face, and looked
into her eyes. Perhaps she realized--with the swift
intuition of a clever woman-- the man&rsquo;s perplexity,
for instantly she led his mind to other things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But let us not talk of ourselves any more,
to-night. There is so much I wish to know; so much
that ought to be done.&rdquo; She sprang to her feet.
&ldquo;Why, it is almost shameful for us to stay here,
selfishly happy, while others are in such trouble.
Have they discovered Hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we scoured the whole town and found no
trace. Now they are outside on the prairie, but there
can be little chance of their picking up a trail before
daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Hawley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has vanished also; without doubt they are
together. What do you suppose he can want of her?
How do you imagine he ever got her to go with him?
She isn&rsquo;t that sort of a girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her head, shivering a little.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have mistaken her for me--perhaps has
not even yet discovered his mistake. But what it all
means, or how he gained her consent to go with him,
I cannot conceive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood with hands clasped, staring out the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a little light showing already,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, pointing. &ldquo;See, yonder. Oh, I
trust they will find her alive, and unhurt. That man,
I believe, is capable of any crime. But couldn&rsquo;t
you be of some help? Why should you remain here with
me? I am in no danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You really wish me to go, Christie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not that way--not that way,&rdquo; and she
turned impulsively, with hands outstretched. &ldquo;Of
course I want you here with me, but I want you to help
bring Hope back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew her to him, supremely happy now, every feeling
of embarrassment lost in complete certainty of possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I will,&rdquo; he said solemnly. &ldquo;Wherever
they may have gone I shall follow. I am going now,
dear, and when I come back you&rsquo;ll be glad to
see me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I?&rdquo; her eyes uplifted to his own,
and swimming in tears. &ldquo;I will be the happiest
girl in all the world, I reckon. Oh, what a night this
has been! What a wonderful night! It has given me
a name, a mother, and the man I love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He kissed her, not in passion, but in simple tenderness,
and as he turned away she sank upon her knees at the
window, with head bowed upon the sill. At the door
he paused, and looked back, and she turned, and smiled
at him. Then he went out, and she knelt there silently,
gazing forth into the dawn, her eyes blurred with
tears--facing a new day, and a new life.</p>

<h2>Following the Trail</h2>

<p>The withdrawal of the sheriff merely stimulated Keith
to greater activity. It was clearly evident the fugitives
were endeavoring with all rapidity possible to get
beyond where the hand of law could reach them-- their
trail striking directly across the plains into the
barren southwest was proof of this purpose. Yet it
was scarcely likely they would proceed very far in
that direction, as such a course would bring them straight
into the heart of the Indian country, into greater
danger than that from which they fled. Keith felt
no doubt that Hawley intended making for Carson City,
where he could securely hide the girl, and where he
possessed friends to rally to his defence, even an
influence over the officers of the law. The one thing
which puzzled him most was the man&rsquo;s object in
attempting so desperate a venture. Did he know his
prisoner was Hope Waite? or did he still suppose he
was running off with Christie Maclaire? Could some
rumor of Waite&rsquo;s appeal to the courts have reached
the gambler, frightened him, and caused him to attempt
this desperate effort at escape? and did he bear Miss
Maclaire with him, hoping thus to keep her safely
concealed until he was better prepared to come out
in open fight? If this was the actual state of affairs
then it would account for much otherwise hard to explain.
The actress would probably not have been missed, or,
at least, seriously sought after, until she failed
to appear at the theatre the following evening. This
delay would give the fugitives a start of twenty hours,
or even more, and practically assure their safety.
Besides, in the light of Waite&rsquo;s application
to the sheriff for assistance, it was comparatively
easy to conceive of a valid reason why Hawley should
vanish, and desire, likewise, to take Miss Maclaire
with him. But there was no apparent occasion for his
forcible abduction of Hope. Of course, he might have
done so from a suddenly aroused fit of anger at some
discovery the girl had made, yet everything pointed
rather to a deliberate plan. Both horses and men were
certainly waiting there under orders, Hawley&rsquo;s
adherents in charge, and every arrangement perfected
in advance. Clearly enough, the gambler had planned
it all out before he ever went to the Trocadero--no
doubt the completion of these final arrangements was
what delayed his appearance at the hotel. If this
was all true, then it must have been Christie, and
not Hope, he purposed bearing away with him, and the
latter was merely a victim of her masquerade.</p>

<p>What would result when the man discovered his mistake?
Such a discovery could not be delayed long, although
the girl was quick-witted, and would surely realize
that her personal safety depended upon keeping up the
deception to the last possible moment. Yet the discovery
must finally occur, and there was no guessing what
form Hawley&rsquo;s rage would assume when he found
himself baffled, and all his plans for a fortune overturned.
Keith fully realized Hope&rsquo;s peril, and his own
helplessness to serve her in this emergency was agony.
As they hurried back to the town, he briefly reviewed
these conclusions with Waite and Fairbain, all alike
agreeing there was nothing remaining for them to do
except to take up the trail. The fugitives had already
gained too great an advantage to be overhauled, but
they might be traced to whatever point they were heading
for. In spite of the start being so far to the west,
Keith was firmly convinced that their destination
would prove to be Carson City.</p>

<p>Procuring horses at the corral, their forces augmented
by two volunteers-- both men of experience--Keith,
Waite, Fairbain, and Neb departed without delay, not
even pausing to eat but taking the necessary food with
them. The sun had barely risen when they took up the
trail, Keith, and a man named Bristoe, slightly in
advance, their keen eyes marking every slight sign
left for guidance across the bare plain. It was a comparatively
easy trail to follow, leading directly into the southwest,
the pony tracks cutting into the sod as though the
reckless riders had bunched together, their horses
trotting rapidly. Evidently no attempt had been made
at concealment, and this served to convince the pursuers
that Hawley still  believed his captive to be Miss
Maclaire, and that her disappearance would not be
suspected until after nightfall. In that case the trail
could not be discovered before the following morning,
and with such a start, pursuit would be useless. Tireless,
steadily, scarcely speaking except upon the business
in hand, the pursuers pressed forward at an easy trot,
Keith, in spite of intense anxiety, with the remembrance
of old cavalry days to guide him, insisting upon sparing
the horses as much as possible. This was to be a stern
chase and a long one, and it was impossible to tell
when they could procure remounts. The constant swerving
of the trail westward seemed to shatter his earlier
theory, and, brought him greater uneasiness. Finally
he spoke of it to the old plainsman beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose those fellows are heading
so far west for, Ben? They are taking a big risk of
running into hostiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned the
other gravely, lifting his eyes to the far-off sky
line. &ldquo;I reckon from the news thet come in last
night from Hays, thar ain&rsquo;t no Injuns a rangin&rsquo;
thet way jist now. They&rsquo;re too blame busy out
on the Arickaree. Maybe them fellers heerd the same
story, an&rsquo; thet&rsquo;s what makes &rsquo;em
so bold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What story? I&rsquo;ve heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s like this, Cap,&rdquo; drawling
out the words, &ldquo;leastways, thet&rsquo;s how
it come inter Sheridan; &lsquo;Sandy&rsquo; Forsythe
an&rsquo; his outfit, mostly plainsmen, started a
while ago across Solomon River an&rsquo; down Beaver
Crick, headin&rsquo; fer Fort Wallace. Over on the
Arickaree, the whole damned Injun outfit jumped &rsquo;em.
From all I heerd, thar must a bin nigh onto three thousan&rsquo;
o&rsquo; the varmints, droppin&rsquo; on &rsquo;em
all at oncet, hell-bent-fer-election, with ol&rsquo;
Roman Nose a leadin&rsquo; &rsquo;em. It was shore
a good fight, fer the scouts got onto an island an&rsquo;
stopped the bucks. Two of the fellers got through
to Wallace yist&rsquo;day, an&rsquo; a courier brought
the news in ter Hays. The Injuns had them boys cooped
up thar fer eight days before them fellers got out,
an&rsquo; I reckon it&rsquo;ll be two or three days
more &rsquo;fore the nigger sogers they sent out ter
help ever git thar. So thar won&rsquo;t be no Injuns
&rsquo;long this route we&rsquo;re travellin&rsquo;,
fer the whole kit an&rsquo; caboodle are up thar yit
after &lsquo;Sandy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you suppose Hawley knew about this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not, Cap? He was hangin&rsquo; &lsquo;round
till after ten o&rsquo;clock las&rsquo; night, an&rsquo;
it was all over town by then. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely
he&rsquo;s got an outfit &rsquo;long with him thet&rsquo;s
lost any Injuns. I don&rsquo;t know whar they&rsquo;re
bound, no mor&rsquo;n you do, but I reckon they&rsquo;re
reasonably sure they&rsquo;ve got a clar road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They pulled up on the banks of a small stream to water
their horses, and ate hastily. The trail led directly
across, and with only the slightest possible delay
they forded the shallow water, and mounted the opposite
bank. A hundred yards farther on, Bristoe reined up
suddenly, pointing down at the trail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One hoss left the bunch here,&rdquo; he declared
positively. Keith swung himself out of the saddle,
and bent over to study the tracks. There was no doubting
the evidence--a single horse--the only one shod in
the bunch-- with a rider on its back, judging from
the deep imprint of the hoofs, had swerved sharply
to the left of the main body, heading directly into
the southeast. The plainsman ran forward for a hundred
yards to assure himself the man had not circled back;
at that point the animal had been spurred into a lope.
Keith rejoined the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have been about daylight they reached
here,&rdquo; he said, picking up-- his dangling rein,
and looking into the questioning faces about him. &ldquo;The
fellow that rode out yonder alone was heading straight
toward Carson City. He is going for fresh horses,
I figure it, and will rejoin the bunch some place
down on the Arkansas. The others intend to keep farther
west, where they won&rsquo;t be seen. What do you
say, Ben?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s the way it looms up ter me, Cap;
most likely &rsquo;twas the boss himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, whoever it was, the girl is still with
the others, and their trail is the easiest to follow.
We&rsquo;ll keep after them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They pushed on hour after hour, as long as day-light
lasted or they could perceive the faintest trace to
follow. Already half-convinced that he knew the ultimate
destination of the fugitives, Keith yet dare not venture
on pressing forward during the night, thus possibly
losing the trail and being compelled to retrace their
steps. It was better to proceed slow and sure. Besides,
judging from the condition of their own horses, the
pursued would be compelled to halt somewhere to rest
their stock also. Their trail even revealed the fact
that they were already travelling far less rapidly
than at first, although evidently making every effort
to cover the greatest possible distance before stopping.
Just as the dusk shut in close about them they rode
down into the valley of Shawnee Fork, and discovered
signs of a recent camp at the edge of the stream. Here,
apparently, judging from the camp-fire ashes, and
the trampled grass along the Fork, the party must
have halted for several hours. By lighting matches
Keith and Bristoe discerned where some among them
had laid down to sleep, and, through various signs,
decided they must have again departed some five or
six hours previous, one of their horses limping as
if lame. The tired pursuers went into camp at the
same spot, but without venturing to light any fire,
merely snatching a cold bite, and dropping off to sleep
with heads pillowed upon their saddles.</p>

<p>They were upon the trail again with the first dimness
of the gray dawn, wading the waters of the Fork, and
striking forth across the dull level of brown prairie
and white alkali toward the Arkansas. They saw nothing
all day moving in that wide vista about them, but
rode steadily, scarcely exchanging a word, determined,
grim, never swerving a yard from the faint trail.
The pursued were moving slower, hampered, no doubt,
by their lame horse, but were still well in advance.
Moreover, the strain of the saddle was already beginning
to tell severely on Waite, weakened somewhat by years,
and the pursuers were compelled to halt oftener on
his account. The end of the second day found them
approaching the broken land bordering the Arkansas
valley, and just before nightfall they picked up a
lame horse, evidently discarded by the party ahead.</p>

<p>By this time Keith had reached a definite decision
as to his course. If the fugitives received a fresh
relay of horses down there somewhere, and crossed
the Arkansas, he felt positively sure as to their destination.
But it would be useless pushing on after them in the
present shape of his party--their horses worn out,
and Waite reeling giddily in the saddle. If Hawley&rsquo;s
outfit crossed the upper ford, toward which they were
evidently heading, and struck through the sand hills,
then they were making for the refuge of that lone
cabin on Salt Fork. Should this prove true, then it
was probable the gambler had not even yet discovered
the identity of Hope,  for if he had, he would scarcely
venture upon taking her there, knowing that Keith
would naturally suspect the spot. But Keith would not
be likely to personally take up the trail in search
for Christie Maclaire. It must have been Hawley then
who had left the party and ridden east, and up to
that time he had not found out his mistake. Yet if
he brought out the fresh animals the chances were
that Hope&rsquo;s identity would be revealed. Bristoe,
who had turned aside to examine the straying horse,
came trotting up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Belonged to their outfit all right, Cap,&rdquo;
he reported, &ldquo;carries the double cross brand
and that shebang is upon the Smoky; saddle galls still
bleeding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Waite was now suffering so acutely they were obliged
to halt before gaining sight of the river, finding,
fortunately, a water-hole fed by a spring. As soon
as the sick man could be made comfortable, Keith gave
to the others his conclusions, and listened to what
they had to say. Bristoe favored clinging to the trail
even though they must travel slowly, but Fairbain
insisted that Waite must be taken to some town where
he could be given necessary care. Keith finally decided
the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;None can be more anxious to reach those fellows
than I am,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;but I know that
country out south, and we&rsquo;ll never get through
to the Salt Fork without fresh horses. Besides, as
the doctor says, we&rsquo;ve got to take care of Waite.
If we find things as I expect we&rsquo;ll ride for
Carson City, and re-outfit there. What&rsquo;s more,
we won&rsquo;t lose much time--it&rsquo;s a shorter
ride from there to the cabin than from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By morning the General was able to sit his saddle
again, and leaving him with Neb to follow slowly,
the others spurred forward, discovered an outlet through
the bluff into the valley, and crossed the Santa F&eacute;
Trail. It was not easy to discover where those in
advance had passed this point, but they found evidence
of a late camp in a little grove of cottonwoods beside
the river. There were traces of two trails leading
to the spot, one being that of the same five horses
they had been following so long, the other not so
easily read, as it had been traversed in both directions,
the different hoof marks obliterating each other.
Bristoe, creeping about on hands and knees, studied
the signs with the eyes of an Indian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You kin see the diff&rsquo;rence yere whar
the ground is soft, Cap,&rdquo; he said, pointing
to some tracks plainer than the others. &ldquo;This
yere hoss had a rider, but the rest of &rsquo;em was
led; thet&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;ve bungled up ther
trail so. An&rsquo; it wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t ther same
bunch thet went back east what come from thar--see
thet split hoof! thar ain&rsquo;t no split hoof p&rsquo;inting
ther other way--but yere is the mark of the critter
thet puts her foot down so fur outside thet we&rsquo;ve
been a trailin&rsquo; from Sheridan, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s
p&rsquo;inting east, an&rsquo; being led. Now, let&rsquo;s
see whar the bunch went from yere with thet split
hoof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was not so easily accomplished owing to the nature
of the ground, but at last the searchers stumbled
onto tracks close in under the bank, and one of these
revealed the split hoof.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That makes it clear, Ben,&rdquo; exclaimed
Keith, decidedly, staring out across the river at
the white sandhills. &ldquo;They have kept in the edge
of the water, making for the ford, which is yonder
at the bend. They are out in the sand desert by this
time riding for the Salt Fork. Whoever he was, the
fellow brought them five horses, and the five old ones
were taken east again on the trail. The girl is still
with the party, and we&rsquo;ll go into Carson City
and reoutfit.&rdquo;</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXXIV"></a>Chapter XXXIV</h1>

<h2>Again at the Cabin</h2>

<p>They were two weary days reaching Carson City, travelling
along the open trail yet meeting with no one, not
even a mail coach passing them. Evidently the Indians
were so troublesome as to interrupt all traffic with
Santa F&eacute; and the more western forts. The slowness of
their progress was on account of the General, whose
condition became worse in spite of Fairbain&rsquo;s
assiduous attentions. With no medicine the doctor could
do but little to relieve the sufferings of the older
man, although he declared that his illness was not
a serious one, and would yield quickly to proper medical
treatment. They constructed a rude travois from limbs
of the cottonwood, and securely strapped him thereon,
one man leading the horse, while the doctor tramped
behind.</p>

<p>Keith, fretting more and more over this necessary
delay, and now obsessed with the thought that Hawley
must have rejoined his party on the Arkansas and gone
south with them, finally broke away from the others
and rode ahead, to gather together the necessary horses
and supplies in advance of their arrival. He could
not drive from his mind the remembrance of the gambler&rsquo;s
attempted familiarity with Hope, when he had her, as
he then supposed, safe in his power once before in
that lonely cabin on the Salt Fork. Now, angry with
baffled ambition, and a victim of her trickery, there
was no guessing to what extremes the desperado might
resort. The possibilities of such a situation made
the slightest delay in rescue an agony almost unbearable.
Reaching Carson City, and perfectly reckless as to
his own safety there from arrest, the plainsman lost
no time in perfecting arrangements for pushing forward.
Horses and provisions were procured, and he very fortunately
discovered in town two cowboys belonging to the &ldquo;Bar
X&rdquo; outfit, their work there accomplished and
about ready to return to, the ranch on the Canadian,
who gladly allied themselves with his party, looking
forward to the possibilities of a fight with keen
anticipation. Keith was more than ever delighted with
adding these to his outfit, when, on the final arrival
of the others, the extra man brought from Sheridan
announced that he had had enough, and was going to
remain there. No efforts made revealed any knowledge
of Hawley&rsquo;s presence in Carson City; either
he had not been there, or else his friends were very
carefully concealing the fact. The utter absence of
any trace, however, led Keith to believe that the
gambler had gone elsewhere--probably to Fort Larned--for
his new outfit, and this belief left him more fully
convinced than ever of the fellow&rsquo;s efforts
to conceal his trail.</p>

<p>The party escorting Waite reached the town in the
evening, and in the following gray dawn, the adventurers
forded the river, and mounted on fresh horses and
fully equipped, headed forth into the sand hills. The
little company now consisted of Keith, Fairbain, who,
in spite of his rotundity of form had proven himself
hard and fit, Neb, having charge of the single pack-horse,
the scout Bristoe, and the two cowboys of the &ldquo;Bar
X,&rdquo; rough, wiry fellows, accustomed to exposure
and peril. It was emphatically a fighting outfit,
and to be trusted in emergency.</p>

<p>They followed the cattle trail south toward the Salt
Fork, as this course would afford them a camp at the
only water-hole in all that wide desert lying between.
With this certainty of water, they ventured to press
their animals to swifter pace, although the sand made
travelling heavy, and the trail itself was scarcely
discernible. It was a hard, wearisome ride, hour after
hour through the same dull, dreary landscape of desolation,
the hot, remorseless sun beating down upon them, reflecting
up into their blistered faces from the hot surface
of sand. There was scarcely a breath of air, and the
bodies of men and horses were bathed in perspiration.
Not a cloud hung in the blue sky; no wing of a bird
broke the monotony of distance, no living animal crept
across the blazing surface of the desert. Occasionally
a distant mirage attracted the eye, making the dead
reality even more horrible by its semblance to water,
yet never tempting them to stray aside. After the
first mile conversation ceased, the men riding grimly,
silently forward, intent only on covering all the distance
possible. Late that night they camped at the water-hole,
sleeping as best they could, scourged by the chill
wind which swept over them and lashed grit into exposed
faces. With the first gray of dawn they swung stiffened
forms into the saddles and rode on, straight as the
crow flies, for the Salt Fork. They attained that
stream at sundown, gray with sand dust, their faces
streaked from perspiration, feeling as though the sun
rays had burned their brains, with horses fairly reeling
under them. According to Keith&rsquo;s calculation
this cattle-ford must be fully ten miles below where
the cabin sought was situated; two hours&rsquo; rest,
with water and food, would put both horses and men
again in condition, and the travelling was easier along
the banks of the Fork. With this in mind, cinches
were loosened, the animals turned out to graze, and
the men, snatching a hasty bite, flung themselves
wearily on the ground.</p>

<p>All but Fairbain were asleep when Keith aroused them
once more, a little before nine, unable in his impatience
to brook longer delay. Within ten minutes horses were
saddled, weapons looked to carefully, and the little
party began their advance through the darkness, moving
cautiously over the uneven ground, assisted greatly
by the bright desert stars gleaming down upon them
from the cloudless sky overhead. The distance proved
somewhat less than had been anticipated, and Keith&rsquo;s
watch was not yet at eleven, when his eyes revealed
the fact that they had reached the near vicinity of
the lonely island on which the cabin stood. Reining
in his horse sharply, he swung to the ground, the
others instantly following his example, realizing
they had reached the end of the route. Hands instinctively
loosened revolvers in readiness for action, the younger
of the &ldquo;Bar X&rdquo; men whistling softly in
an effort to appear unconcerned. Keith, with a gesture,
gathered them more closely about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If Hawley is here himself,&rdquo; he said quietly,
watching their faces in the starlight, &ldquo;he will
certainly have a guard set, and there may be one anyhow.
We can&rsquo;t afford to take chances, for there will
be five men, at least, on the island, and possibly
several more. If they are looking for trouble they
will naturally expect it to come from the north--consequently
we&rsquo;ll make our attack from the opposite direction,
and creep in on them under the shadow of the corral.
The first thing I want to do is to locate Miss Waite
so she will be in no danger of getting hurt in the
<i>m&ecirc;le&eacute;</i>.  You boys hold your fire, until I let
loose or give the word. Now, Doctor, I want you and
Neb to creep up this bank until you are  directly
opposite the cabin--he&rsquo;ll know the spot--and
lie there out of sight until we begin the shooting.
Then both sail in as fast as you can. I&rsquo;ll take
Bristoe and you two &lsquo;Bar X&rsquo; men along with
me, and when we turn loose with our shooting irons
you can all reckon the fight is on. Any of you got
questions to ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>No one said anything, the silence accented by the
desert wind howling mournfully in the branches of
a near-by cottonwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then, boys, don&rsquo;t get excited
and go off half cocked; be easy on your trigger fingers.
Come along, you fellows who are travelling with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four crossed the stream, wading to their waists
in the water, their horses left bunched on the south
bank, and finally crawled out into a bunch of mesquite.
As they crept along through the darkness, whatever
doubts Keith might have previously felt regarding the
presence on the island of the party sought, were dissipated
by the unmistakable noise made by numerous horses
in the corral. Slowly, testing each step as they advanced,
so no sound should betray them, the four men reached
the shelter of the stockade. The older of the &ldquo;Bar
X&rdquo; men lifted himself by his hands, and peered
cautiously over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight hosses in thar,&rdquo; he announced soberly;
then turned to Keith. &ldquo;Say, Jack, what do you
figure this shebang to be, anyhow? You don&rsquo;t
reckon it&rsquo;s old Sanchez&rsquo;s outfit, do yer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Likely as not, Joe, though I never saw him
around here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe filled his cheek with tobacco, staring about through
the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, if that ol&rsquo; cuss is yere now we&rsquo;uns
is sure in fer a fight,&rdquo; he commented positively.</p>

<p>They rounded the corral fence on hands and knees,
crawled into a bunch of bushes somewhat to the rear
of the silent, desolate-appearing cabin, and lay down
flat behind a pile of saddles, from which position
they could plainly discern the rear door. There was
no movement, no evidence anywhere that a living soul
was about the place. Keith could barely distinguish
that it was Bristoe lying next to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had their camp over there in the corner of
the corral when I was here before,&rdquo; he said
in a whisper. &ldquo;Where do you suppose they can
be now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wary scout lifted his head, sniffing into the
darkness like a pointer dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;West o&rsquo; ther cabin thar, out o&rsquo;
ther wind, most likely. I smell tobacco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as the words left his lips a man came sauntering
slowly around the eastern corner, his outlines barely
visible, but the red glow of a pipe bowl showing plainly.
He stopped, directly facing them, yawning sleepily,
and then turned the other corner. Another moment, and
they distinctly heard a voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hustle up thar now, Manuel, an&rsquo; turn
out; it&rsquo;s your watch; wake up, damn yer--maybe
that&rsquo;ll bring yer ter life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remedy applied to the sleeper must have been efficacious,
as, an instant later, another figure slouched into
view, the new arrival rubbing his eyes with one hand,
the other clutching a short-barrelled gun. From the
high peak of his hat it was evident this new guard
was a Mexican. He walked to the corner, glanced along
the east side wall toward the front of the cabin,
and then, apparently satisfied the coast was clear,
started toward the stream, shuffling along within
a foot of where Keith lay flat on the ground. A moment
later the men heard him splashing softly in the water,
and Keith rolled over, his lips at Bristoe&rsquo;s
ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slip down there; Ben,&rdquo; he whispered,
&ldquo;and quiet that fellow. I&rsquo;ll find out
how many are on the west side. Do the job without any
noise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited until the scout had disappeared like a snake,
not even a rustling leaf telling of his passage, and
then silently crept forward himself, yet with less
caution, until he was able to peer about the corner
of the cabin and dimly distinguish the blanketed forms
of several men lying close in against the side wall.
They rested so nearly together it was difficult to
separate them in that darkness, stars giving the only
light, but he finally determined their number at five.
Five; the Mexican would make six, and there would
surely be another guard posted out in the front--seven.
But there were eight horses down there in the corral.
Then the eighth man--Hawley, without doubt--must be
in the cabin. At the thought Keith&rsquo;s teeth clinched,
and he had to struggle to control his passion. But
no; that would never do; he must discover first exactly
where the girl was located; after that they would
attend to the curs. Before creeping back to the others,
he made quick examination along the rear of the cabin,
but could find no visible point of weakness. He tried
to recall from memory the nature of the lock on that
back door, but could remember nothing except an ordinary
wooden latch. If he could insert a knife into the
crack that might very easily be dislodged. He drew
his hunting knife for the attempt, and, first glancing
about, perceived a man creeping toward him. It proved
to be Bristoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fixed the greaser all right, cap, and I reckon
he&rsquo;ll be quiet for an hour or two. Look whar
he slashed me; struck a pack o&rsquo; playin&rsquo;
keerds, er I&rsquo;d a got my ticket.&rdquo; The front
of his blouse was cut wide open, and Keith thought
he perceived a stain of blood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pricked you as it was, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Opened the skin. Thought the cuss had give
up, an&rsquo; got careless. What&rsquo;s &rsquo;round
to the west?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith&rsquo;s lips closed, his hand shutting hard
on the knife.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Five, and another out in front; that leaves
the eighth man inside. Bring our fellows up closer,
and post them where they can cover those fellows asleep,
while I make an effort at breaking in here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bristoe crawled back like a snail, and confident the
others would do their part, Keith thrust his knife
blade deep into the narrow crack, and began probing
after the latch. In spite of all caution this effort
caused a slight noise, and suddenly he started back,
at the sound of a woman&rsquo;s voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want? I am armed, and will fire
through the door if you do not go away!&rdquo;</p>

<p>His heart leaping with exultation, Keith put his lips
close to the crack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; he exclaimed as loudly as he dared.
&ldquo;This is Keith; open the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could hear a little smothered cry break from her
lips, and then the sound of a bar being hastily removed.
An instant, and the door opened silently, just wide
enough to permit her slender figure to slip through.
She grasped him with her hands, turning his face to
the light of the stars, and he could feel her form
tremble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knew you would come! I knew you would
come!&rdquo; she sobbed, the words barely audible.</p>

<p>The man&rsquo;s lips set firmly, yet he held her close
to him, begging her not to break down now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, little girl,&rdquo; he
said pleadingly, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got you safe,
but there is a fight to be attended to. Come with me;
I must ask you a question or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew her back into the fringe of bushes, placing
her safely behind the stack of saddles. She was not
crying any more, just clinging to him, as though she
could never again bear to let him go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jack, it is so good just to feel you near
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; soothingly, &ldquo;and it
is good to hear you say Jack, but tell me one thing--is
any one else in the cabin? Is Hawley here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! He left us early the first morning.
I haven&rsquo;t either seen or heard of him since.
The men have left me alone since we got here; I have
had the cabin all to myself until to-night. I have
not suffered, only mentally--from dread of what they
intended doing with me--until to-night. Three men
rode in here just before sundown--two Mexicans and
an Indian. One of them was an awful looking old man,
with a scar on his cheek, and a face that made me
shudder. He didn&rsquo;t see me, but I saw him through
the window, and he had such strange eyes. All the
men acted as though they were afraid of him, and I
heard him say he didn&rsquo;t care what Hawley&rsquo;s
orders were, he was going to sleep inside; if the girl
didn&rsquo;t like it she could take the other room.
I didn&rsquo;t know what to do--oh, I was so afraid
of him; but what he said gave me an idea, and I went
into the back room, and put up a bar across the door.
When he came in he tried the door; then he spoke through
it, but I never answered; and finally he lay down and
went to sleep. I sat there in the dark so long, and
when I heard you--I--I thought it must be some of
the others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stroked her hair, whispering words of encouragement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is all done with now, Hope, and we&rsquo;ll
have those fellows at our mercy in another half-hour.
But I must go now to the boys; lie down here behind
these saddles, and don&rsquo;t move until I come for
you. I can trust you to remain right here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He was bending over, and her eyes
were upon his face. Suddenly, obeying an irresistible
impulse, he clasped her to him, and their lips met.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; he whispered softly.</p>

<p>He could not hear her answer, but her arms were about
his neck.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXXV"></a>Chapter XXXV</h1>

<h2>The Cabin Taken</h2>

<p>His heart beating with new happiness, yet conscious
of the stern duty still confronting him, Keith joined
the others, giving them, in a whisper, a hurried account
of Hope&rsquo;s release from the cabin, and of what
she had to report.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Juan Sanchez in the front room,
boys,&rdquo; he added soberly, &ldquo;and there is
ten thousand dollars reward out for him, dead or alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe of the &ldquo;Bar X&rdquo; drew in his breath
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll sure be dead then,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;that cuss will never be got no other way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went at it in the grim silent manner of the West,
wasting little time, feeling no mercy. One by one
the unconscious sleepers were aroused, each waking
to find a steel barrel pressing against his forehead,
and to hear a stern voice say ominously, &ldquo;Not
a move, Johnny; yes, that&rsquo;s a gun; now get up
quietly, and step out here.&rdquo; Resistance was useless,
and the five, rendered weaponless, were herded back
toward the corral. They all belonged to Hawley&rsquo;s
outfit; one, a black-whiskered surly brute Bristoe
remembered having seen in Sheridan. There was no time
to deal with them then, and a &ldquo;Bar X&rdquo;
man was placed on guard, with orders to shoot at the
slightest suspicious movement.</p>

<p>The Indian, then, would be guarding the front of the
house, and Sanchez sleeping inside. Well, the former
could be left alone; his chance of escape would be
small enough with Fairbain and Neb on the opposite
bank. Old Sanchez was the villain they wanted--dead
or alive. With this in view, and anxious to make a
quick job of it, the three entered the back room,
and, revolvers in hand, groped their way across to
the connecting door. As Hope had described, this had
been securely fastened by a stout wooden bar. Bristoe
forced it from the sockets, not without some slight
noise, and Keith, crouching down at one side, lifted
the latch. &ldquo;Keep down low, boys,&rdquo; he cautioned,
&ldquo;where he can&rsquo;t hit you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With one quick push he flung the door wide open, and
a red flash lit the room. There were two sharp reports,
the bullets crashing into the wall behind them, the
sudden blaze of flame revealing the front door open,
and within it the black outline of a man&rsquo;s figure.
Two of the men fired in instant response, leaping
recklessly forward, but were as quickly left blind
in the darkness, the outer door slammed in their faces.
Outside there was a snarl of rage, another shot, a
fierce curse in Spanish; then Keith flung the door
wide open, and leaped down the step. As he did so he
struck a body, and fell forward, his revolver knocked
from his hand. Rising to his knees, the dim light
of the stars revealed a man already half across the
stream. Suddenly two sparks of fire leaped forth from
the blackness of the opposite bank; the man flung
up his hand, staggered, then went stumbling up the
stream, knee deep in water. He made a dozen yards,
reeling as though drunk, and fell forward, face down
across a spit of sand. Keith stared out at the black,
motionless shape, felt along the ground for his lost
gun, and arose to his feet. Bristoe had turned over
the dead body at the foot of the steps, and was peering
down into the upturned face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Indian,&rdquo; he said grimly,
&ldquo;Sanchez must &lsquo;a&rsquo; mistook him fer
one of us, and shot the poor devil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Sanchez himself is out yonder on that sand-spit,&rdquo;
and Keith pointed; then lifted his voice to make it
carry across the stream. &ldquo;Come on over, Doctor,
you and Neb. We&rsquo;ve got the gang. Bring that body
out there along with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Bar X&rdquo; man waded out to help, and
the three together laid the dead Mexican outlaw on
the bank beside the Indian he had shot down in his
effort to escape. Keith stood for a moment bending
low to look curiously into the dead face--wrinkled,
scarred, still featuring cruelty, the thin lips drawn
back in a snarl. What scenes of horror those eyes had
gazed upon during fifty years of crime; what suffering
of men, women, children; what deeds of rapine; what
examples or merciless hate. Juan Sanchez!--the very
sound of the name made the blood run cold. &ldquo;Dead
or alive!&rdquo; Well, they had him at last--dead;
and the plainsman shuddered, as he turned away.</p>

<p>Taking Fairbain with him, and hastily reviewing late
occurrences to him, Keith crossed over to the corral,
realizing that their work--his work--was not wholly
done until Hawley had been located. With this quest
in mind he strode straight to the black-bearded giant
who had guarded Hope from Sheridan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>The man looked up scowling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hatchett,&rdquo; he answered gruffly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Hatchett, I am going to ask you a question
or two, and advise you to reply just about as straight
as you know how. I am in no mood to-night for any
foolishness. Where is &lsquo;Black Bart&rsquo; Hawley?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How in hell should I know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do know, just the same. Perhaps not to
an inch, or a mile, but you know near enough where
he is, and where he has been since you left Sheridan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do, I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? Well now, Hatchett, listen to me,&rdquo;
and Keith&rsquo;s voice had in it the click of a steel
trap. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll either answer, and answer
straight, or we&rsquo;ll hang you to that cottonwood
in about five minutes. If you want a chance for your
miserable life you answer me. We have our way of treating
your kind out in this country. Sit up, you brute! Now
where did Hawley go after he left you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To Fort Larned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After those fresh horses?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t bring them to you; I know that.
Where has he been since?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Topeky and Leavenworth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He writ me a note the boss herder brought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hand it over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith took the dirty slip of paper the man reluctantly
extracted from his belt, and Fairbain lit matches
while he ran his eyes hastily over the lines. As he
ended he crushed the paper between his fingers, and
walked away to the end of the corral. He wanted to
be alone, to think, to decide definitely upon what
he ought to do. Hawley, according to the schedule
just read, must have left Larned alone early the day
before; this night he would be camped at the water-hole;
with daybreak he expected to resume his lonely journey
across the desert to the Salt Fork. For years Keith
had lived a primitive life, and in some ways his thought
had grown primitive. His code of honor was that of
the border, tinged by that of the South before the
war. The antagonism existing between him and this gambler
was personal, private, deadly--not an affair for any
others--outsiders--to meddle with. He could wait here,
and permit Hawley to be made captive; could watch
him ride unsuspectingly into the power of these armed
men, and then turn him over to the law to be dealt
with. The very thought nauseated him. That would be
a coward&rsquo;s act, leaving a stain never to be eradicated.
No, he must meet this as became a man, and now, now
before Hope so much as dreamed of his purpose--aye,
and before he spoke another word of love to Hope.
He wheeled about fully decided on his course, his duty,
and met Fairbain face to face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; the latter said earnestly, &ldquo;I
read the note over your shoulder, and of course I
know what you mean to do. A Southern gentleman could
not choose otherwise. But I&rsquo;ve come here to
beg you to let me have the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; surprised and curious. &ldquo;What
greater claim on that fellow&rsquo;s life have you
than I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pudgy hands of the doctor grasped the plainsman&rsquo;s
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Christie,&rdquo; he explained
brokenly. &ldquo;She was the one he tried to run away
with. You--you know how I feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; shaking the other off,
yet not roughly. &ldquo;But it happened to be Miss
Waite he took, and so this is my job, Fairbain. Besides,
I&rsquo;ve got another score to settle with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wasted little time upon preparations,--a few brief
words of instruction to Bristoe; a request to the
doctor not to leave Hope alone; the extracting of
a promise from the two &ldquo;Bar X&rdquo; men to return
to Larned with the prisoners. Then he roped the best
horse in the corral, saddled and bridled him, and
went into the cabin. She had a light burning, and met
him at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you would never come, but they told
me you were unhurt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a scratch, little girl; we have been a
lucky bunch. But I have had a great deal to look after.
Now I shall be obliged to ride ahead as far as the
water-hole, and let you come on with the others a little
later, after you get breakfast. You can spare me a
few hours, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His tone was full of good humor, and his lips smiling,
yet somehow she felt her heart sink, an inexplicable
fear finding expression in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But--but why do you need to go? Couldn&rsquo;t
some of the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a reason which I will explain later,&rdquo;
he said, more gravely. &ldquo;Surely you can trust
me, Hope, and feel that I am only doing what it seems
absolutely necessary for me to do?&rdquo; He bent down,
and kissed her. &ldquo;It will be only for a few hours,
and no cause for worry. Good-bye now, until we meet
to-night at the water-hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The east was gray with coming daylight as he rode
plashing across the stream and up the opposite bank.
She watched hint, rubbing the blinding mist from her
eyes, until horse and man became a mere dark speck,
finally fading away completely into the dull plain
of the desert.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXXVI"></a>Chapter XXXVI</h1>

<h2>The Duel in the Desert</h2>

<p>Keith rode straight forward into the sandy desolation,
spurring his horse into a swift trot. After one glance
backward as they clambered up the steep bank, a glance
which revealed Hope&rsquo;s slender form in the cabin
door, his eyes never turned again that way. He had
a man&rsquo;s stern work to do out yonder, and his
purpose could not be swerved, his firmness of hand
and keenness of eye affected, by any thought of her.
His lips compressed, his fingers gripping the rein,
he drove all regretful memory from his mind, until
every nerve within him throbbed in unison with his
present purpose. He was right; he knew he was right.
It was not hate, not even revenge, which had sent
him forth, leaving love behind, but honor--the honor
of the South, and of the frontier, of his ancestry
and his training--honor that drove him now to meet
Hawley face to face, man to man, to settle the feud
between them for all time. And he rode smiling, gladly,
as to a tryst, now that he was at last alone, free
in the desert.</p>

<p>The hours passed, the sun rising higher in the blazing
blue of the sky; the horse, wearied by the constant
pull of the sand, had long since slowed down to a
walk; the last dim blur of the cottonwoods along the
Fork had disappeared; and the rider swayed in the
saddle, the dead lifelessness of sky and desert dulling
his brain. Yet he had not forgotten his errand-- rousing
constantly from lethargy to sweep his shaded eyes about
the rounded horizon, keenly marking the slightest
shadow across the sands, taking advantage of every
drift to give him wider viewpoint, rising in his stirrups
to scan the leagues of desolation ahead. Twice he drew
his revolver from out its sheath, tested it, and slipped
in a fresh cartridge, returning the weapon more lightly
to its place, the flap of the holster turned back
and held open by his leg. The sun beat upon him like
a ball of fire, the hot sand flinging the blaze back
into his face. He pushed back the upper part of his
shirt, and drank a swallow of tepid water from a
canteen strapped behind the saddle. His eyes ached
with the glare, until he saw fantastic red and yellow
shapes dancing dizzily before him. The weariness of
the long night pressed upon his eye-balls; he felt
the strain of the past hours, the lack of food, the
need of rest. His head nodded, and he brought himself
to life again with a jerk and a muttered word, staring
out into the dim, formless distance. Lord, if there
was only something moving; something he could concentrate
his attention upon; something to rest the straining
eyes!</p>

<p>But there was nothing, absolutely nothing--just that
seemingly endless stretch of sand, circled by the
blazing sky, the wind sweeping its surface soundless,
and hot, as though from the pits of hell; no stir,
no motion, no movement of anything animate or inanimate
to break the awful monotony. Death! it was death everywhere!
his aching eyes rested on nothing but what was typical
of death. Even the heat waves seemed fantastic, grotesque,
assuming spectral forms, as though ghosts beckoned
and danced in the haze, luring him on to become one
of themselves. Keith was not a dreamer, nor one to
yield easily to such brain fancies, but the mad delirium
of loneliness gripped him, and he had to struggle
back to sanity, beating his hands upon his breast
to stir anew the sluggish circulation of his blood,
and talking to the horse in strange feverishness.</p>

<p>With every step of advance the brooding silence seemed
more profound, more deathlike. He got to marking the
sand ridges, their slight variations giving play to
the brain. Way off to the left was the mirage of a
lake, apparently so real that he had to battle with
himself to keep from turning aside. He dropped forward
in the saddle, his head hanging low, so blinded by
the incessant sun glare he could no longer bear the
glitter of that horrible ocean of sand. It was noon
now--noon, and he had been riding steadily seven hours.
The thought brought his blurred eyes again to the
horizon. Where could he be, the man he sought in the
heart of this solitude? Surely he should be here by
now, if he had left the water-hole at dawn. Could
he have gone the longer route, south to the Fork? The
possibility of such a thing seared through him like
a hot iron, driving the dulness from his brain, the
lethargy from his limbs. God! no! Fate could never
play such a scurvy trick as that! The man must have
been delayed; had failed to leave camp early--somewhere
ahead, yonder where the blue haze marked the union
of sand and sky, he was surely coming, riding half
dead, and drooping in the saddle.</p>

<p>Again Keith rose in his stirrups, rubbing the mist
out of his eyes that he might see clearer, and stared
ahead. What was that away out yonder? a shadow? a
spot dancing before his tortured vision? or a moving,
living something which he actually saw? He could not
tell, he could not be sure, yet he straightened up
expectantly, shading his eyes, and never losing sight
of the object. It moved, grew larger, darker, more
real--yet how it crawled, crawled, crawled toward
him. It seemed as if the vague, shapeless thing would,
never take form, never stand out revealed against the
sky so he could determine the truth. He had forgotten
all else--the silent aesert, the blazing sun, the
burning wind--all his soul concentrated on that speck
yonder. Suddenly it disappeared--a swale in the sand
probably-- and, when it rose into view again, he uttered
a cry of joy--it was a horse and rider!</p>

<p>Little by little they drew nearer one another, two
black specks in that vast ocean of sand, the only
moving, living things under the brazen circle of the
sky. Keith was ready now, his eyes bright, the cocked
revolver gripped hard in his hand. The space between
them narrowed, and Hawley saw him, caught a glimpse
of the face under the broad hat brim, the burning
eyes surveying him. With an oath he stopped his horse,
dragging at his gun, surprised, dazed, yet instantly
understanding. Keith also halted, and across the intervening
desert the eyes of the two men met in grim defiance.
The latter wet his dry lips, and spoke shortly:  &ldquo;I
reckon you know what this means, Hawley, and why I
am here. We&rsquo;re Southerners both of us, and we
settle our own personal affairs. You&rsquo;ve got to
fight me now, man to man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gambler glanced about him, and down at his horse.
If he thought of flight it was useless. His lip curled
with contempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn your talking, Keith,&rdquo; he returned
savagely. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it over with,&rdquo;
and spurred his horse. The gun of the other came up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; and Hawley paused, dragging at
his rein. &ldquo;One of us most likely is going to
die here; perhaps both. But if either survives he&rsquo;ll
need a horse to get out of this alive. Dismount; I&rsquo;ll
do the same; step away so the horses are out of range,
and then we&rsquo;ll fight it out--is that square?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without a word, his eyes gleaming with cunning hatred,
the gambler swung down from his saddle onto the sand,
his horse interposed between him and the other. Keith
did the same, his eyes peering across the back of his
animal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said steadily, &ldquo;when I
count three drive your horse aside, and let go--are
you ready?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn you--yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then look out--one! two! three!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plainsman struck his horse with the quirt in his
left hand, and sprang swiftly aside so as to clear
the flank of the animal, his shooting arm flung out.
There was a flash of flame across Hawley&rsquo;s saddle,
a sharp report, and Keith reeled backward, dropping
to his knees, one hand clutching the sand. Again Hawley
fired, but the horse, startled by the double report,
leaped aside, and the ball went wild. Keith wheeled
about, steadying himself with his outstretched hand,
and let drive, pressing the trigger, until, through
the haze over his eyes, he saw Hawley go stumbling
down, shooting wildly as he fell. The man never moved,
and Keith endeavored to get up, his gun still held
ready, the smoke circling about them. He had been
shot treacherously, as a cowardly cur might shoot,
and he could not clear his mind of the thought that
this last act hid treachery also. But he could not
raise himself, could not stand; red and black shadows
danced before his eyes; he believed he saw the arm
of the other move. Like a snake he crept forward,
holding himself up with one hand, his head dizzily
reeling, but his gun held steadily on that black,
shapeless object lying on the sand. Then the revolver
hand began to quiver, to shake, to make odd circles;
he couldn&rsquo;t see; it was all black, all nothingness.
Suddenly he went down face first into the sand.</p>

<p>They both lay motionless, the thirsty sand drinking
in their life blood, Hawley huddled up upon his left
side, his hat still shading the glazing eyes, Keith
lying flat, his face in the crook of an arm whose hand
still gripped a revolver. There was a grim smile on
his lips, as if, even as he pitched forward, he knew
that, after he had been shot to death, he had gotten
his man. The riderless horses gazed at the two figures,
and drifted away, slowly, fearfully, still held in
mute subjection to their dead masters by dangling
reins. The sun blazed down from directly overhead,
the heat waves rising and falling, the dead, desolate
desert stretching to the sky. An hour, two hours passed.
The horses were now a hundred yards away, nose to
nose; all else was changeless. Then into the far northern
sky there rose a black speck, growing larger and larger;
others came from east and west, beating the air with
widely outspread wings, great beaks stretched forward.
Out from their nests of foulness the desert scavengers
were coming for their spoil.</p>

<h1><a name="chap_XXXVII"></a>Chapter XXXVII</h1>

<h2>At the Water-Hole</h2>

<p>Up from the far, dim southwest they rode slowly, silently,
wearied still by the exertions of the past night,
and burned by the fierce rays of the desert sun. No
wind of sufficient force had blown since Keith passed
that way, and they could easily follow the hoof prints
of his horse across the sand waste. Bristoe was ahead,
hat brim drawn low, scanning the horizon line unceasingly.
Somewhere out in the midst of that mystery was hidden
tragedy, and he dreaded the knowledge of its truth.
Behind him Fairbain, and Hope rode together, their
lips long since grown silent, the man ever glancing
uneasily aside at her, the girl drooping slightly in
the saddle, with pale face and heavy eyes. Five prisoners,
lashed together, the binding ropes fastened to the
pommels of the two &ldquo;Bar X&rdquo; men&rsquo;s
saddles, were bunched together, and behind all came
Neb, his black face glistening in the heat.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bristoe drew rein, and rose to his full length
in the stirrups, shading his eyes from the sun&rsquo;s
glare, as he stared ahead. Two motionless black specks
were visible--yet were they motionless? or was it the
heat waves which seemed to yield them movement? He
drove in his spurs, driving his startled horse to
the summit of a low sand ridge, and again halted,
gazing intently forward. He was not mistaken--they
were horses. Knowing instantly what it meant--those
riderless animals drifting derelict in the heart of
the desert--his throat dry with fear, the scout wheeled,
and spurred back to his party, quickly resolving on
a course of action. Hawley and Keith had met; both
had fallen, either dead or wounded. A moment&rsquo;s
delay now might cost a life; he would need Fairbain,
but he must keep the girl back, if possible. But could
he? She straightened up in the saddle as he came spurring
toward them; her eyes wide open, one hand clutching
at her throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he called as soon as he was
near enough, his horse circling, &ldquo;thar is somethin&rsquo;
showin&rsquo; out yonder I&rsquo;d like ter take a
look at, an&rsquo; I reckon you better go &lsquo;long.
The nigger kin com&rsquo; up ahead yere with Miss
Waite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She struck her horse, and he plunged forward, bringing
her face to face with Bristoe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? Tell me, what is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; but a loose hoss, Miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A horse! here on the desert?&rdquo; looking
about, her eyes dark with horror. &ldquo;But how could
that be? Could--could it be Captain Keith&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bristoe cast an appealing glance at Fairbain, mopping
his face vigorously, not knowing what to say, and
the other attempted to turn the tide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not likely--not likely at all--no reason why
it should be--probably just a stray horse--you stay
back here, Miss Hope--Ben and I will find out, and
let you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at the two faces, realizing intuitively
that they were concealing something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; she cried, stifling
a sob in her throat. &ldquo;It would kill me to wait
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was off before either might raise hand or voice
in protest, and they could only urge their horses
in effort to overtake her, the three racing forward
fetlock deep in sand. Mounted upon a swifter animal
Fairbain forged ahead; he could see the two horses
now plainly, their heads uplifted, their reins dangling.
Without perceiving more he knew already what was waiting
them there on the sand, and swore fiercely, spurring
his horse mercilessly, forgetful of all else, even
the girl, in his intense desire to reach and touch
the bodies. He had begged to do this himself, to be
privileged to seek this man Hawley, to kill him--but
now he was the physician, with no other thought except
a hope to save. Before his horse had even stopped
he flung himself from the saddle, ran forward and dropped
on his knees beside Keith, bending his ear to the chest,
grasping the wrist in his fingers. As the others approached,
he glanced up, no conception now of aught save his
own professional work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water, Bristoe,&rdquo; he exclaimed sharply,
&ldquo;Dash some brandy in it. Quick now. There, that&rsquo;s
it; hold his head up--higher. Yes, you do it, Miss
Hope; here, Ben, take this, and pry his teeth open--well,
he got a swallow anyhow. Hold him just as he is--can
you stand it? I&rsquo;ve got to find where he was
hit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes--yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t--don&rsquo;t
mind me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tore open the woolen shirt, soaked with blood already
hardening, felt within with skilled fingers, his eyes
keen, his lips muttering unconsciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quarter of an inch--quarter of an inch too
high--scraped the lung--Lord, if I can only get it
out--got to do it now--can&rsquo;t wait--here, Bristoe,
that leather case on my saddle--run, damn you--we&rsquo;ll
save him yet, girl-- there, drop his head in your
lap--yes, cry if you want to--only hold still--open
the case, will you--down here, where I can reach it--now
water--all our canteens--Hope, tear me off a strip
of your under-skirt-- what am I going to do?--extract
the ball--got to do it--blood poison in this sun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She ripped her skirt, handing it to him without a
word; then dropped her white face in her hands, bending,
with closed eyes, over the whiter face resting on
her lap, her lips trembling with the one prayer, &ldquo;Oh,
God! Oh, God!&rdquo; How long he was at it, or what
he did, she scarcely knew--she heard the splash of
water; caught the flash of the sun on the probe; felt
the half conscious shudder of the wounded man, whose
head was in her lap, the deft, quick movements of
Fairbain, and then--</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it--I&rsquo;ve got it--missed
the lung by a hair--damn me I&rsquo;m proud of that
job--you&rsquo;re a good girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him, scarce able to see, her eyes blinded
with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will--will he live? Oh, tell me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Live! Why shouldn&rsquo;t he?--nothing but
a hole to close up--nature&rsquo;ll do that, with
a bit of nursing--here, now, don&rsquo;t you keel over--give
me the rest of that skirt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bandaged the wound, then glanced about suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the other fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead,&rdquo; returned Bristoe, &ldquo;shot
through the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thought so--have seen Keith shoot before--I
wonder how the cuss ever managed to get him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he arose to his feet, his red face glistening with
perspiration, and began strapping his leather case,
the others rode up, and Bristoe, explaining the situation,
set the men to making preparations for pushing on
to the water-hole. Blankets were swung between ponies,
and the bodies of the dead and wounded deposited therein,
firm hands on the bridles. Hope rode close beside
Keith, struggling to keep back the tears, as she watched
him lying motionless, unconscious, scarcely breathing.
So, under the early glow of the desert stars, they
came to the water-hole, and halted.</p>

<p>The wounded man opened his eyes, and looked about
him unable to comprehend. At first all was dark, silent;
then he saw the stars overhead, and a breath of air
fanned the near-by fire, the ruddy glow of flame flashing
across his face. He heard voices faintly, and thus,
little by little, consciousness asserted itself and
memory struggled back into his bewildered brain. The
desert--the lonely leagues of sand--his fingers gripped
as if they felt the stock of a gun--yet that was all
over--he was not there--but he was somewhere--and
alive, alive. It hurt him to move, to breathe even,
and after one effort to turn over, he lay perfectly
still, staring up into the black arch of sky, endeavoring
to think, to understand--where was he? How had he
come there? Was Hawley alive also? A face bent over
him, the features faintly visible in the flash of
firelight. His dull eyes lit up in sudden recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doc! is that you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, old man,&rdquo; the pudgy fingers feeling
his pulse, the gray eyes twinkling. &ldquo;Narrow
squeak you had--going to pull through all right, though--no
sign of fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the water-hole; sling you in a blanket,
and get you into Larned to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, Keith finding
it hard to speak.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hawley--?&rdquo; he whispered at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry; you got him all right.
Say,&rdquo; his voice sobering, &ldquo;maybe it was
just as well you took that job. If it had been me I
would have been in bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wounded man&rsquo;s eyes questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad mix-up, Keith. Waite never
told us all of it. I reckon he didn&rsquo;t want her
to know, and she never shall, if I can help it. I Ve
been looking over some papers in his pocket--he&rsquo;d
likely been after them this trip--and his name ain&rsquo;t
Hawley. He&rsquo;s Bartlett Gale, Christie&rsquo;s
father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Keith could not seem to grasp the thought, his eyes
half-closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her--her father?&rdquo; ne questioned, weakly.
&ldquo;Do you suppose he knew?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; not at first, anyhow; not at Sheridan.
He was too interested in his scheme to even suspicion
he had actually stumbled onto the real girl. I think
he just found out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A coyote howled somewhere in the darkness, a melancholy
chorus joining in with long-drawn cadence. A shadow
swept into the radius of dancing firelight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he conscious, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fairbain drew back silently, and she dropped on her
knees at Keith&rsquo;s side, bending low to look into
his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope--Hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, and you are going to live now--live
for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He found her hand, and held it, clasped within his
own, his eyes wide open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never told you,&rdquo; he said, softly,
&ldquo;how much I love you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She bent lower until her cheek touched his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Jack, but you may now.&rdquo;</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
PMB 113
1739 University Ave.

the US Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) organization with EIN

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
